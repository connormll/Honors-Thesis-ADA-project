REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION1

I. Introduction
This case has been referred to us for consideration of a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Paragon Systems (Paragon). The plaintiff, Laralee Riemensnyder, is a former Court Security Officer (CSO) who was employed by Paragon before a series of illnesses led to her taking medical leave and eventually being medically separated from her position. In her complaint, the plaintiff alleges Paragon violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. ¶ 791, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA), and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because its decision to terminate her employment was discriminatory based on her disability and gender. She also alleges that Paragon unlawfully harassed her and retaliated against her.
Despite these allegations, the evidence shows that Paragon's decision to end Riemensnyder's [*2]  employment as a CSO came after standardized medical testing determined she was no longer able to meet the physical requirements of the position. The medical standards for CSOs are essential to ensure the safety and security of the Middle District courts and were known to Riemensnyder from the time she began her employment with Paragon. Riemensnyder has presented no evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to find that she was terminated for any other reason but the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason that she was no longer physically able to perform the essential duties of the job. Accordingly, we recommend that summary judgment be granted in favor of the defendants.

II. Statement and Facts of the Case
Paragon is a private security company that provides CSOs to perform armed security guard services in federal courthouse facilities. (Doc. 99, ¶ 2). The United States Marshal Service (USMS) contracted Paragon to provide armed security guard services for the Third Federal Judicial Circuit, including the courts in the Middle District of Pennsylvania. (Id., ¶ 3). Paragon's contract with USMS states that USMS has the right at all times to determine the suitability of any Paragon employee [*3]  to serve as a CSO. (Id., ¶ 6). According to the contract, because the medical condition of the CSO workforce is critical to the overall safety of the federal judiciary, USMS reserves the right to require a CSO to undergo a medical examination whenever necessary to ensure the safety and security of the judiciary, and medical clearance of CSOs is determined based on the results of each required medical exam. (Id., ¶¶ 11-12). The medical determination process is conducted by Federal Occupational Health (FOH), a governmental agency which is unaffiliated with any of the parties, which then determines whether a CSO is medically qualified or disqualified to perform under the contract. (Id., ¶ 19)
In 2015, Riemensnyder began working as a CSO at the Scranton Federal Building. (Doc. 45, at 1). The plaintiff was originally employed in the CSO position by another contractor, Akal, which subsequently lost its contract with USMS and was replaced by Paragon. (Doc. 99, ¶¶ 23-26). The plaintiff then obtained employment as a CSO for Paragon. (Id., ¶ 29). The terms of Riemensnyder's employment agreement with Paragon describe the requirement that CSOs meet the medical qualifications determined by USMS, [*4]  (Doc. 100-3, at 15), although, as the plaintiff points out, the employment documents do not specify the precise medical ailments that may disqualify an individual from serving as a CSO.
The plaintiff described many of the duties of her position in her deposition, acknowledging that CSOs are responsible for the safety of the courts, court employees, and the public, must be able to deal with disorderly individuals, respond first to security alarms and breaches at judges' residences, carry firearms and are responsible for disarming individuals, and are the "first line of officers" dealing with an active shooter. (Doc. 110, at 119-131). Also, as noted on the Judicial Security Medical Review Form, and acknowledged by Riemensnyder in her deposition, CSOs are required to be prepared to attempt to subdue a physically attacking person; physically control violent or unruly crowds; respond to an emergency with unplanned physical activity; run up or down at least two flights of stairs in pursuit of an individual or in an emergency; and perform at a high level of emotional stress. (Doc. 99, ¶ 41; Doc. 100-3, at 41; Doc. 110, at 162-63).
Upon her hiring by Paragon in September of 2017, Riemensnyder [*5]  underwent a physical examination and was deemed physically qualified by FOH to perform these duties. (Doc. 99, ¶ 29). However, in April of 2018, the plaintiff began experiencing shortness of breath and was diagnosed with pneumonia and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). (Id., ¶¶ 43-45). In May 2018, Riemensnyder requested time off from work pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). (Id., ¶ 47). She was prescribed antibiotics for pneumonia, (Id., ¶ 46), but the FMLA paperwork completed by her physician, Dr. James Galasso, described her condition as "lifelong" and indicated she would be unable to perform "all functions" of her job. (Doc. 100-3, at 22). Riemensnyder was approved for twelve weeks of leave pursuant to FMLA and, following a hospitalization in June 2018 for treatment of pneumonia and shortness of breath, requested an extension of her leave for an additional two months, through November 2018. (Doc. 99, ¶¶ 49, 50, 53). In September or October 2018, the plaintiff underwent a heart cauterization by her cardiologist, Dr. Rupp. (Id., ¶ 54). During follow-up tests, it was determined she had a right branch block which necessitated placing stints in her heart. [*6]  (Id.)
In August 2018, nearing the end of the plaintiff's initial twelve weeks of FMLA, Paragon sent the plaintiff a letter indicating that the USMS requested additional information regarding her medical status and including a Medical Review Form detailing "areas of concern and requests for information" from Riemensnyder's doctors. (Id., ¶ 51). The Medical Review Form, completed by Dr. Frederick Glass, a physician with FOH, stated that Riemensnyder's medical determination was deferred pending documentation of the results of a "stress treadmill exercise EKG, using standard Bruce protocol, and pre- and post-exercise-spirometry." (Id., ¶ 52).
The plaintiff submitted additional information to FOH and received a response from Dr. Glass, indicating he had reviewed the documents submitted by the plaintiff including "Return to Work" notes from the plaintiff's doctors Dr. Rupp and Dr. Galasso, as well as Spirometry and Myocardial Perfusion Test results. (Id., ¶ 55). However, Dr. Glass once again had to request the same "stress treadmill exercise EKG using standard Bruce protocol." (Id.) After several requests, the plaintiff finally underwent the requested stress test in February 2019 performed [*7]  by her cardiologist, Dr. Briskie. (Id., ¶ 58). The stress test determined that the plaintiff achieved "METS of 4.6" and that "patient's functional capacity" was "markedly depressed which may be related to her clinical status including COPD heart disease and overall functional deconditioning." (Id.) Based on this result, Dr. Glass determined that Riemensnyder was not medically qualified to perform the essential functions of the CSO position. (Id.)
In April of 2019, Riemensnyder was notified that the USMS directed her removal from the contract due to Medical Disqualification. (Id., ¶ 60). The letter also contained an offer of an Armed Security Officer position with Paragon under a contract with the Department of Homeland Security. (Id., ¶ 61). According to the defendants, this was the only available position in Pennsylvania with the company for which the plaintiff was qualified to perform. (Id., ¶ 62). The plaintiff declined the position, indicating it was four hours away. (Id., ¶ 63; Doc. 110, at 173). Plaintiff has not worked for another employer since being terminated from Paragon. (Doc. 115, ¶ 64).
It is against this factual background that we view the plaintiff's claims of disability [*8]  discrimination, gender discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. Riemensnyder filed her complaint in federal court on January 21, 2020. (Doc. 1). The plaintiff has twice amended her complaint, with her third amended complaint being the operative pleading. (Doc. 45). Following nearly two years of litigation, the defendant filed the instant motion for summary judgment on November 15, 2021. (Doc. 97). The motion is fully briefed and is ripe for disposition. (Docs. 98, 99, 122, 125, 129). After a review of the record, we find that no genuine issue of material fact remains, and the defendant is entitled to judgment on the plaintiff's claims.

II. Discussion

A. Motion for Summary Judgment - Standard of Review
The defendant has moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that the court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Through summary adjudication, a court is empowered to dispose of those claims that do not present a "genuine dispute as to any material fact," Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), and for which a trial would be "an empty and unnecessary formality." Univac Dental Co. v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 702 F.Supp.2d 465, 468 (M.D. Pa. 2010). The substantive [*9]  law identifies which facts are material, and "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute about a material fact is genuine only if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis that would allow a reasonable fact finder to return a verdict for the non-moving party. Id., at 248-49.
The moving party has the initial burden of identifying evidence that it believes shows an absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Conoshenti v. Pub. Serv. Elec. & Gas Co., 364 F.3d 135, 145-46 (3d Cir. 2004). Once the moving party has shown that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's claims, "the non-moving party must rebut the motion with facts in the record and cannot rest solely on assertions made in the pleadings, legal memoranda, or oral argument." Berckeley Inv. Group. Ltd. v. Colkitt, 455 F.3d 195, 201 (3d Cir. 2006), accord Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the non-moving party "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden at trial," summary judgment is appropriate. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. Summary judgment is also appropriate if the non-moving party provides merely colorable, conclusory, or speculative evidence. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. There must be more than a scintilla of evidence supporting [*10]  the non-moving party and more than some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts. Id. at 252; see also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). In making this determination, the Court must "consider all evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." A.W. v. Jersey City Pub. Schs., 486 F.3d 791, 794 (3d Cir. 2007).
Moreover, a party who seeks to resist a summary judgment motion by citing to disputed material issues of fact must show by competent evidence that such factual disputes exist. Further, "only evidence which is admissible at trial may be considered in ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Countryside Oil Co., Inc. v. Travelers Ins. Co., 928 F. Supp. 474, 482 (D.N.J. 1995). Similarly, it is well-settled that: "[o]ne cannot create an issue of fact merely by . . . denying averments . . . without producing any supporting evidence of the denials." Thimons v. PNC Bank, NA, 254 F. App'x 896, 899 (3d Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). Thus, "[w]hen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported . . ., an adverse party may not rest upon mere allegations or denial." Fireman's Ins. Co. of Newark New Jersey v. DuFresne, 676 F.2d 965, 968 (3d Cir. 1982); see also Sunshine Books, Ltd. v. Temple University, 697 F.2d 90, 96 (3d Cir. 1982). "[A] mere denial is insufficient to raise a disputed issue of fact, and an unsubstantiated doubt as to the veracity of the opposing affidavit is also not sufficient." Lockhart v. Hoenstine, 411 F.2d 455, 458 (3d Cir. 1969). Furthermore, "a party resisting a [Rule 56] motion cannot expect to rely merely upon bare assertions, conclusory allegations or suspicions." Gans v. Mundy, 762 F.2d 338, 341 (3d Cir. 1985) (citing Ness v. Marshall, 660 F.2d 517, 519 (3d Cir. 1981)).
Finally, it is emphatically [*11]  not the province of the court to weigh evidence or assess credibility when passing upon a motion for summary judgment. Rather, in adjudicating the motion, the court must view the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the opposing party, Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255, and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, 1363 (3d Cir. 1992). Where the non-moving party's evidence contradicts the movant's, then the non-movant's must be taken as true. Id. Additionally, the court is not to decide whether the evidence unquestionably favors one side or the other, or to make credibility determinations, but instead must decide whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; see also Big Apple BMW, 974 F.2d at 1363. In reaching this determination, the Third Circuit has instructed that:
To raise a genuine issue of material fact . . . the opponent need not match, item for item, each piece of evidence proffered by the movant. In practical terms, if the opponent has exceeded the "mere scintilla" threshold and has offered a genuine issue of material fact, then the court cannot credit the movant's version of events against the opponent, even if the quantity of the movant's evidence [*12]  far outweighs that of its opponent. It thus remains the province of the fact finder to ascertain the believability and weight of the evidence.
Id. In contrast, "[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted); NAACP v. North Hudson Reg'l Fire & Rescue, 665 F.3d 464, 476 (3d Cir. 2011).

B. The Plaintiff Exhausted Her Administrative Remedies Under the ADA and Title VII.
The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act, (ADA) and Title VII, should be dismissed because she did not receive a right to sue letter from the EEOC prior to commencing suit in this court. Although it appears the plaintiff filed a complaint against Paragon with the PHRC and the EEOC on November 9, 2018, (Doc. 122-3), the EEOC did not issue her a right to sue letter until December 27, 2021, nearly two years after she filed her complaint in federal court. (Doc. 126).
Title I of the ADA governs workplace discrimination against the disabled. "Title I [of the ADA] incorporates the administrative procedures of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5. Thus, the plaintiff's ADA and Title VII claims require that she first exhaust administrative remedies before filing an action in court." Cook v. City of Philadelphia, 94 F. Supp. 3d 640, 647 (E.D. Pa. 2015) (cleaned [*13]  up). On this score:
[A] party who brings an employment discrimination claim under Title I of the ADA must follow the administrative procedures set forth in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5. See Bishop v. Okidata, Inc., 864. F.Supp. 416, 424 (D.N.J.1994). Accordingly, a party must wait 180 days after filing a charge with the EEOC for ADA violations before being able to forego the administrative process and file suit in court. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1). After 180 days, "[i]f a complainant is dissatisfied with the progress the EEOC is making on his or her charge of employment discrimination, he or she may elect to circumvent the EEOC procedures and seek relief through a private enforcement action in a district court." Occidental Life Ins. Co. of California v. EEOC, 432 U.S. 355, 361, 97 S.Ct. 2447, 2451, 53 L.Ed.2d 402 (1977).
Churchill v. Star Enterprises, 183 F.3d 184, 190 (3d Cir. 1999).
The plaintiff argues that she has met the exhaustion requirement because she was always entitled to the letter and that her claims were processed through the EEOC office. In support of her argument, she relies upon the Third Circuit's decision in Anjelino v. New York Times Co., 200 F.3d 73 (3d Cir. 1999), where a previously issued right to sue letter did not encompass all of the claims in the plaintiff's amended complaint. The plaintiff points out that she is entitled to a right to sue letter, indeed she received one on December 27, 2021, and has provided evidence that she filed a claim with the PHRC and cross filed with the EEOC on November [*14]  9th, 2018. (Doc. 122-3). As discussed by the Third Circuit in Anjelino:
In Ostapowicz, we set out the procedures for filing discrimination claims and the reasons for following these procedures: When an "aggrieved person" files a claim with the EEOC, the agency notifies the employer and conducts an investigation. If the charge reasonably appears to be true, the EEOC attempts conciliation. If conciliation does not succeed, the EEOC notifies the aggrieved party of his or her right to bring suit. The preliminary step of the filing of the EEOC charge and the receipt of the right to sue notification are "essential parts of the statutory plan, designed to correct discrimination through administrative conciliation and persuasion if possible, rather than by formal court action." Id. at 398. Because the aim of the statutory scheme is to resolve disputes by informal conciliation, prior to litigation, suits in the district court are limited to matters of which the EEOC has had notice and a chance, if appropriate, to settle. Id. at 398.
Anjelino v. New York Times Co., 200 F.3d at 93 (citing Ostapowicz v. Johnson Bronze Co., 541 F.2d 394 (3d Cir. 1976)).
The record demonstrates that the aim of the statutory scheme was at least partially fulfilled when Riemensnyder cross filed her claim with the PHRC and EEOC and the defendant submitted [*15]  its answer. (Doc. 122-4). And, as the plaintiff points out, the requisite 180 days had transpired from the time she filed the PHRC/EEOC complaint until she filed her complaint in this Court. While it is unclear exactly why the plaintiff never received a right to sue letter from the EEOC until nearly two years into this litigation, we recognize the Supreme Court's holding that "a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling." Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 1132, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234 (1982). Other courts have held that, "[w]hile the attainment of a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC is a condition precedent to filing Title VII and ADA suits, the failure to obtain notice of the right to sue is a curable defect." Tlush v. Manufacturers Res. Ctr., 315 F. Supp. 2d 650, 654-55 (E.D. Pa. 2002) (citing Gooding v. Warner-Lambert Co., 744 F.2d 354, 358 (3d Cir. 1984); Jones v. American State Bank, 857 F.2d 494, 500 (8th Cir. 1988)). "Several other Circuit Courts of Appeals have held that the defect is cured if the plaintiff receives a 'right-to-sue' letter prior to trial and neither the EEOC nor defendants are prejudiced by plaintiff's initial failure to obtain the letter." Id. (citing Parry v. Mohawk Motors of Michigan, Inc., 236 F.3d 299, 310 (6th Cir. 2000); Pinkard v. Pullman-Standard, 678 F.2d 1211, 1215 (5th Cir. 1982); Henderson v. Eastern Freight Ways, Inc., 460 F.2d 258, 260 (4th Cir. 1972)). And, as the plaintiff points out, the Third Circuit has declined to "penalize the appellants for [*16]  the EEOC's failure to follow up on the retaliatory discharge charges, or for their attorneys' failure to request right to sue letters, where the appellants were entitled to such letters as a matter of right, 29 C.F.R. § 1601.28(a)(2), and where letters had been received with respect to the initial charges." Anjelino 200 F.3d at 96.
Neither the EEOC nor defendants are prejudiced by the plaintiff's initial failure to obtain the letter because both had notice of the plaintiff's claims after receiving her initial PHRC/EEOC complaint in November of 2018 and the defendant had the opportunity to answer the complaint in the context of the administrative proceeding. (Docs. 122-3, 122-4). The record indicates that the complaint was filed and answered, the plaintiff waited the requisite 180 days to file with the court, and the deficiency was only with the plaintiff's failure to request the right to sue letters. In our view, the purpose of exhaustion has been met without prejudice to the defendants, and therefore the plaintiff has cured the defect by presenting the right to sue letter, albeit after the litigation has already commenced.

C. The Defendant's Motion Should Be Granted on the Merits

1. The Plaintiff's Disability Discrimination and Harassment [*17]  Claims Fail as a Matter of Law.
Having determined that the plaintiff has exhausted her administrative remedies and may properly bring her cause of action in federal court, we next move to the merits of her claims. The defendant first argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because the plaintiff has failed to adduce evidence sufficient to advance her disability discrimination claim under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.
As to the plaintiff's claim under the Rehabilitation Act, she "must demonstrate that: (1) she is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) she was denied the benefits of a program or activity of a public entity which receives federal funds; and (3) she was discriminated against based on her disability." Calloway v. Boro of Glassboro Dep't of Police, 89 F.Supp.2d 543, 551 (D.N.J. 2000) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 794(a)). The defendant argues the remaining defendant in this case, Paragon Systems, is not a public entity which receives federal funds. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania has addressed this exact issue in cases involving a former USMS contractor that provided CSOs to the Middle District courthouses:
The plaintiff's claims under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADEA require us to determine whether the CSOs are "employees" of the USMS. See 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1)-(3); Williams v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth. Police Dept., 380 F.3d 751, 771-72 (3d Cir.2004). We have previously [*18]  addressed this issue in both Wilson and Leitch, which involved virtually identical contracts and factual allegations. Wilson v. MVM, Inc., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6409, 2004 WL 765103, at *2-8 (E.D.Pa. Apr.1, 2004), vacated in part, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9242, 2004 WL 1119926 (E.D.Pa. May 18, 2004) and Leitch v. MVM, Inc., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14307, 2004 WL 1638132, at *4-5 (Jul. 22, 2004). In determining whether the plaintiff CSO's in Wilson and Leitch were employees of the USMS, we considered the terms of the undisputed labor contract and applied the thirteen factor test outlined in Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730, 751-752, 109 S.Ct. 2166, 104 L.Ed.2d 811 (1989). Wilson,  2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6409, 2004 WL 765103, at *2-8; Leitch, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14307, 2004 WL 1638132, at *4-5.
The following reasoning from both cases is applicable here:
No single factor in the Reid analysis is dispositive, and instead "all of the incidents of the relationship must be assessed and weighed." Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U.S. 318, 324, 112 S.Ct. 1344, 117 L.Ed.2d 581 (1992) (quoting NLRB v. United Ins. Co. of A m., 390 U.S. 254, 258, 88 S.Ct. 988, 19 L.Ed.2d 1083 (1968)). A weighing of all thirteen factors convinces us that MVM and thus the plaintiff[ ] were independent contractors with respect to the USMS and the federal government. The USMS specifically contracted with MVM, a private company which is recognized by agreement to be an independent contractor of the federal government. The USMS did not hire the plaintiff [ ], did not pay [him] a salary or withhold taxes, and did not provide [him] with benefits. Instead, it paid MVM monthly upon receiving MVM's invoice. While it had some supervisory role, the USMS did not decide which CSO was going to work or when he or she was going to work. Moreover, the CSOs are to be highly skilled. [*19]  It is true that the USMS requires the CSOs to meet certain levels of hearing and physical fitness and can disqualify them for failure to meet those levels. Nonetheless, this type of contractual provision does not militate against a finding that MVM and plaintiff[ ] were independent contractors vis a vis the federal government. See Fischer v. United States, 441 F.2d 1288, 1291 (3d Cir.1971). Finally, the plaintiff[ ] ... [is] part of a Union which has entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement with MVM, not with the USMS or any other agency of the federal government. In sum, the plaintiff[ ] [is an] employee[ ] of MVM. The relationship of MVM and the plaintiff[ ] to the federal government is one of independent contractor.
McGovern v. MVM, Inc., No. CIV.A.04-2541, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22958, 2004 WL 2554565, at *1-2 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 9, 2004). We find this analysis applies with equal force to the instant case. Accordingly, as the plaintiff was not an employee of the federal government, with respect to her claims under the Rehabilitation Act, the defendant's motion for summary judgment should be granted. Further, as we note below, even if Riemensnyder were somehow deemed to be a government employee, her disability discrimination claim founders on other legal obstacles.
As to the plaintiff's disability discrimination claim under the ADA, the purpose of the ADA is to "prevent employment [*20]  discrimination of qualified individuals on account of their disability." Koller v. Riley Riper Hollin & Colagreco, 850 F.Supp.2d 502, 512 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). The Act requires employers to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical and mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability, unless the employer demonstrates that such accommodations would impose an undue hardship in the operation of their business." Id. (quoting Fleck v. WILMAC, Corp., No. 10-5562, 2011 WL 1899198, AT *4, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54039, at *10 (E.D. Pa. May 19, 2011)).
To make out a prima facie claim for workplace discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he is (1) disabled within the meaning of the ADA, (2) is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations by the employer, and (3) has suffered an adverse employment decision as a result of the discrimination. Sulima v. Tobyhanna Army Depot, 602 F.3d 177, 185 (3d Cir. 2010); see also Stadtmiller v. UPMC Health Plan, Inc., 491 F. App'x 334, 336 (3d Cir. 2012); Gaul v. Lucent Techs., 134 F.3d 576, 580 (3d Cir. 1998). The same standards govern in cases alleging discrimination under the PHRA. Wilson v. Iron Tiger Logistics, Inc., 628 F. App'x 832, 835-36 (3d Cir. 2015) ("The analytical framework used to evaluate a disability discrimination claim under the PHRA is effectively indistinguishable from that under the ADA, thus allowing courts to dispose of both ADA and PHRA claims on the same grounds.") (citing Rinehimer v. Cemcolift, Inc., 292 F.3d 375, 382 (3d Cir. 2002)).
If the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing under this three-part standard, the burden shifts to [*21]  the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse employment action. Id. If a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is given, then the plaintiff must present evidence to demonstrate that the defendant's reasons were pretext for its unlawful action. Id. The plaintiff may meet this burden by identifying evidence that allows a factfinder either to disbelieve the employer's articulated legitimate justification, or to conclude that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a "but for" cause of the employment action. Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir. 1994).
The defendant argues it is entitled to summary judgment because the plaintiff is unable to prove a prima facie case of disability discrimination. Specifically, Paragon advances two claims, asserting: (1) that the plaintiff is not disabled within the meaning of the ADA and (2) arguing that she was not the subject of unlawful discrimination because she could not satisfy the essential physical prerequisites of the CSO position.
First, the defendant argues that the plaintiff is not disabled because she is not substantially limited in a major life activity, there is no record of her impairment, and Paragon did not regard her has disabled. [*22]  The ADA was substantially amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA"), Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (as codified in provisions of 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq.), which became effective as of January 1, 2009, and, therefore, the amendments to the ADA area applicable to this case. In passing the amendments to the legislation:
Congress has made clear that the question of whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis. Indeed, Congress has instructed that in construing the definition of 'disability' under the ADA, it shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals under the ADA, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the [ADA].
Rubano v. Farrell Area Sch. Dist., 991 F.Supp.2d 678, 690 (W.D. Pa. 2014) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Congress's purpose in amending the ADA was to "reinstat[e] a broad scope of protection" under the ADA. Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 § 2(b). Under this statutory mandate, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") revised its implementing regulations to define disability "broadly in favor of expansive coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.1(c)(4). Review of the definitions provided by the Act and its implementing regulations make clear the expansive reach of the statute's protections.
Under the ADAAA, to qualify as disabled, a plaintiff [*23]  must prove one of the following: (1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; (2) a record of such impairment; or (3) being regarded as having such impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). The ADA defines "disability", in pertinent part, as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). "Major life activities" include functions such as "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, interacting with others, and working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i)(1)(i). In determining examples of major life activities, the regulations provide that the term "major" shall not be interpreted to create a "demanding standard" for disability. Id. § 1630.2(i)(2).
With respect to major life activities, the regulations provide that the term "substantially limits" shall be defined broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to "the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA" and also is "not meant to be a demanding standard." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i). An impairment is considered a disability "if it substantially [*24]  limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population." Id. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). However, an impairment "need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting," Id., although "not every impairment will constitute a disability[.]" Id.
In support of its argument that the plaintiff is not substantially limited in a major life activity, the defendant relies on the plaintiff's testimony that her COPD does not limit her day-to-day activities at all, including her ability to walk, climb stairs, run, or jog. While it is true the plaintiff testified in her deposition that she did not believe herself to be disabled, (Doc. 100-2, at 27), the medical evidence demonstrates that she was diagnosed with moderate COPD, a chronic medical condition that causes shortness of breath, and that she had a "markedly depressed" cardiac capacity. (Doc. 99, ¶¶ 43-44; Doc. 100-3, at 42). Further, although the plaintiff testified that her COPD did not limit her day-to-day activities, (Doc. 100-2, at 27), she elaborated that this was due to her condition improving [*25]  with the exercises provided by her doctor and admitted to struggling with shortness of breath and bouts of pneumonia. (Id. at 29). The implementing regulations of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 direct our treatment of this issue:
The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether covered entities have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether the individual meets the definition of disability. The question of whether an individual meets the definition of disability under this part should not demand extensive analysis.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.1; see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2 ("Accordingly, the threshold issue of whether an impairment 'substantially limits' a major life activity should not demand extensive analysis."); see also Kessler v. AT & T, No. 3:13-CV-00207, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126888, 2015 WL 5598866, at *6 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 22, 2015). Presented with this statement of congressional intent in the ADA Amendments Act and its implementing regulations, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we find that a jury could conclude that Riemensnyder is disabled within the meaning of the ADA by virtue of her COPD.
The defendant also argues that the plaintiff has failed to prove a prima facie case of discrimination because she is not a qualified individual with [*26]  a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position as required by 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Paragon asserts that the determination made by FOH that Riemensnyder did not meet the minimum physical standards specified by the USMS contract means she was incapable of performing the essential functions of her job. In Paragon's view, the plaintiff's inability to perform the functions of a CSO presented a safety risk to herself and the public, removing her from the protections of the ADA.
The inquiry into what constitutes an essential function of a job "has two parts: '(1) whether the individual has the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements of the position sought, and (2) whether the individual, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of that position.'" Supinski v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 413 F. App'x 536, 539-40 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Turner v. Hershey Chocolate USA, 440 F.3d 604, 611 (3d Cir. 2006)). This determination requires a factual, case-by-case analysis, thus, summary judgment is only appropriate "if we conclude reasonable jurors 'could not but find'" that Riemensnyder was unable to perform the essential functions of her position as CSO. Supinski v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 413 F. App'x 536, 540 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Turner, 440 F.3d at 612). As to which functions are essential, the Third [*27]  Circuit's guidance is instructive:
Under the ADA's implementing regulations, evidence a particular job function is essential may include, but is not limited to:
(i) The employer's judgment as to which functions are essential;
(ii) Written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job;
(iii) The amount of time spent on the job performing the function;
(iv) The consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function;
(v) The terms of a collective bargaining agreement;
(vi) The work experience of past incumbents in the job; and/or
(vii) The current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs. Id. § 1630.2(n)(3).
Supinski v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 413 F. App'x 536, 540 (3d Cir. 2011).
At the outset, the parties disagree as to what level of physical activity the CSO position requires. The defendant asserts that CSOs must be able to engage in physically strenuous activities, including "attempting to subdue a physically attacking person, physically controlling violent crowds, responding to emergencies with unplanned physical activity, and running up or down flights of stairs in pursuit or in an emergency." (Doc. 129, at 16). On the other hand, the plaintiff argues that the CSO position is not a strenuous job, pointing to the essential [*28]  duties from Paragon's job description which include, "Entrance Control, Roving Patrol, Stationary Patrol Assignments, Escort Duties, Garage Parking and Pedestrian Control, Law and Order, Reports and Records, Court Attendance, Preserve Order, Lost and Found." (Doc. 123, at 19). Thus, in the plaintiff's view, she could easily have performed these duties of her position.
We note, however, that Riemensnyder's position rests upon a re-definition of her job duties and upon the plaintiff's belief that she could perform some, but not all, of the duties of a CSO. Yet, it is evident that a CSO, who serves as the first responder in the event of a potential courthouse crisis, must be able to satisfy all of the physical rigors of this demanding job.
Moreover, while the parties disagree as to whether the plaintiff was able to perform the daily activities of the job, the defendant asserts that the plaintiff was unequivocally unable to complete the job-related requirements of the CSO position because the medical review process determined she failed to meet the USMS medical standards required for the job. Significantly, as the defendant points out, the CSO job description includes the requirement that [*29]  a CSO, "[m]ust meet and maintain medical standards as specified by the United States Marshal Service (USMS); the physical demands are based on the contract and must be met by an employee to successfully perform the essential functions of this job." (Doc. 100-3, at 18). Further, Ms. Riemensnyder acknowledged in writing on her hiring forms:
I acknowledge and understand that my eligibility to perform services under the contract will be determined by the USMS based upon meeting all CSO contract qualifications standards. These qualifications include successful completion of an initial and biennial medical examination . . . I acknowledge and agree that if I fail, at any time, to meet any of the CSO qualification standards, I will be prohibited from performing services under the USMS contract.
(Doc. 100-3, at 15).
The defendants have produced the Medical Review Forms issued by FOH detailing the medical review process and how it arrived at its decision that Riemensnyder was not medically qualified to perform the essential functions of the CSO position. The Medical Review Forms were completed by Dr. Frederick Glass, a physician with FOH who was not affiliated with any party and reviewed the medical [*30]  records provided by Riemensnyder's treating physicians. (Doc. 99, ¶ 52). Dr. Glass reviewed the documents submitted by the plaintiff including the Return-to-Work Notes from doctors Michael Rupp, MD and James Galasso, DO, PCP, as well as Spirometry and Myocardial Perfusion test results. (Id., ¶ 55). Dr. Glass also requested a "stress treadmill exercise EKG, using standard Bruce protocol" which was performed by Riemensnyder's cardiologist, Dr. Briskie and provided to Dr. Glass. (Id., ¶¶ 56, 58). The stress test determined that the plaintiff achieved "METS of 4.6" and that "patient's functional capacity is markedly depressed which may be related to her clinical status including COPD heart disease and overall functional deconditioning." (Id., ¶ 58). Based on this result, Dr. Glass determined that Riemensnyder was not medically qualified to perform the essential functions of the CSO position. Specifically, Dr. Glass found that:
Studies have demonstrated that the above law enforcement duties require a minimum of 10 METS of energy output. Incumbent has significant cardiac disease and the stress test performed on 02/01/2019 demonstrated the examinee's inability to perform to the level required [*31]  for safe and effective job performance. Her inability to perform the essential functions of the job (e.g., running in pursuit and the subduing an individual, dragging a colleague or victim out of harm's way, or running up 2-3 flights of stairs in an emergency) does not meet the required medical standard for the job. Therefore, it is recommended that the examinee be found not medically qualified for the position of Court Security Officer.
(Doc. 100-3, at 41). Thus, the medical opinion of Dr. Glass was that Riemensnyder was unable to perform the essential functions of her position based on the results from the stress test. And, while the plaintiff argues that the fact that she was cleared to return to work by her physicians is evidence that she was able to perform the essential functions of the job, she has presented no evidence to demonstrate that she is able to perform the functions mentioned by Dr. Glass, including running in pursuit and subduing an individual, dragging a colleague or victim out of harm's way, or running up 2-3 flights of stairs in an emergency. Instead, Riemensnyder appears to argue that those functions are not essential, and that the CSO position is actually not [*32]  a strenuous job. Unfortunately for the plaintiff, under the ADA, "consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential. . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). The physical requirements of the CSO position are well documented and "ensure the safety and security of the federal judiciary." (Doc. 99, ¶ 11). The medical record indicates that, based on the cardiac evaluation performed by Dr. Briskie, the plaintiff would not physically be capable of performing several of the essential functions of the CSO position. Further, we note that the nature of the CSO position, which is integral to courthouse security, made performance of all of these functions an essential aspect of the job.
Simply put, given these independent medical findings, Riemensnyder has failed to show that she was capable of performing the tasks of a CSO, Since she has not shown that she was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, Riemensnyder's disability discrimination claim fails. Further, the plaintiff's attempt to demonstrate that the application of the CSO medical standards in his case was pretextual is unpersuasive. The plaintiff argues that "Paragon created a reason - FOH's [*33]  recommendation" to terminate her employment when the real reason was her COPD diagnosis.
The plaintiff attempts to show pretext by demonstrating that a similarly situated employee, CSO Timothy Keiper, was allowed to return to work with only a doctor's note after taking a medical leave of absence and was not required to undergo any additional tests or physical examination. However, as the defendant points out, Keiper is not similarly situated to Riemensnyder. Keiper had shoulder surgery, not COPD or any similar ailment, and was not required to undergo similar medical tests because of this stark difference in diagnosis. (Doc. 108, at 15). He was also not treated disparately from Riemensnyder. Although the plaintiff argues that Keiper was allowed to return from medical leave of absence with "just a doctor's note" his testimony demonstrates that he had to undergo a physical upon his return and that he initially had to return to his doctor to clarify a restriction on his ability to lift due to his surgery. (Id.) This demonstrates that, similarly to Riemensnyder, Keiper was required to meet the USMS physical requirements before his return to his position as a CSO. Riemensnyder has provided [*34]  no evidence which demonstrates that Paragon's motives were discriminatory. Thus, no factfinder could conclude that Paragon's legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for not permitting the plaintiff to return to work was a pretext for disability discrimination.
Finally, the plaintiff premises her disability claim on the assertion that Paragon failed to accommodate her disability. As the Third Circuit has summarized:
An employer discriminates against a qualified individual when it does "not make reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of the individual unless the [employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the [employer]." Id. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "Reasonable accommodation" means measures such as "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, ... and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." Id. § 12111(9).
Turner v. Hershey Chocolate U.S., 440 F.3d 604, 608 (3d Cir. 2006). Thus, an employee must prove that "1) the employer knew about the employee's disability; 2) the employee requested accommodations or assistance for his or her disability; 3) the employer [*35]  did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and 4) the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith." Colwell v. Rite Aid Corp., 602 F.3d 495, 504 (3d Cir. 2010).
The plaintiff's argument that Paragon discriminated against her by failing to provide reasonable accommodations for her disability fails for at least two reasons. First, she has presented no evidence to demonstrate that she requested any accommodation. In fact, as the defendant points out, the plaintiff presented notes from her physicians indicating she needed no restriction and testified that she had no restrictions on her ability to work. (Doc. 114-1; Doc. 100-2, at 14).
Further, after Paragon learned that Riemensnyder failed to meet the medical requirements under its contract with USMS, it attempted to accommodate Riemensnyder by offering to reassign her to the job of Armed Security Officer with another agency. (Doc. 99, ¶ 61, 62). On this score, "[i]f an employer has offered reassignment as a reasonable accommodation, then the employee must offer evidence showing both that the position offered was inferior to [the employee's] former job and that a comparable position for which the employee was [*36]  qualified was open." Gardea v. JBS USA, LLC, 915 F.3d 537, 542 (8th Cir. 2019) (citing Kallail v. Alliant Energy Corp. Servs., Inc., 691 F.3d 925, 933 (8th Cir. 2012)).
Riemensnyder testified that she declined the position because it was four hours away. (Doc. 100-2, at 117). Paragon asserts that, other than the position offered to the plaintiff, there were no jobs with Paragon within the jurisdiction of the Middle District or the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. (Doc. 99, ¶ 62). Riemensnyder also admitted that there were no other comparable positions for which she would qualify, only other CSO positions, and testified that she did not apply for any other positions with Paragon after receiving notice of her medical disqualification. (Doc. 100-2, at 117).
Not only did Riemensnyder's medical disqualification make it unsafe for her to remain in the position of CSO, but the contract between USMS and Paragon prohibited it. Despite the plaintiff failing to request any accommodation, Paragon offered her the only reasonable accommodation available which was a reassignment to a position she would be able to perform given her physical limitations. Riemensnyder declined the accommodation because the position was too far away. Unfortunately for the plaintiff, it is well established that "[a]n employer is not obligated to provide an [*37]  employee the accommodation [she] requests or prefers, the employer need only provide some reasonable accommodation." Kortyna v. Lafayette College, 47 F. Supp. 3d 225, 242 (E.D. Pa. 2014) (quoting Yovtcheva v. City of Philadelphia Water Dep't, 518 Fed. App'x 116, 122 (3d Cir. 2013)); see also Keyhani v. Trs. of the Univ. of Pa., 2019 WL 2568279, *3, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104201, *8 (E.D. Pa. 2019) ("The law is clear that Plaintiff was entitled to reasonable accommodations, but not the accommodations of her choice."); Santacrose v. CSX Transp., Inc., 288 Fed. App'x 655, 657 (11th Cir. 2008) ("While [plaintiff] was not given the precise accommodation he requested ..., a qualified individual with a disability is not entitled to the accommodation of his choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation."). Therefore, the objectively reasonable accommodations that the defendant offered to the plaintiff satisfied their burden under the ADA. Indeed, based on the record, it was the plaintiff who failed to engage in the interactive process to her own detriment.
Since no jury could find the plaintiff has demonstrated evidence showing a prima facie case of discrimination within the meaning of the statute, summary judgment as to her disability discrimination claim under the ADA and PHRA should be granted in favor of the defendants.
Further, while the plaintiff's complaint includes a claim of harassment under the ADA, she does not proffer any evidence to support her claim that she was harassed due to her disability. The plaintiff [*38]  states in a footnote in her response that "her physician was hounded by FOH," but, under the ADA, her claim must show evidence of "harassment so severe or pervasive as to alter the conditions of [her] employment and create an abusive working environment." Ballard-Carter v. Vanguard Grp., 703 F. App'x 149, 152 (3d Cir. 2017) (internal quotations omitted). The plaintiff has provided no such evidence. Since the plaintiff's harassment claim cannot rest upon the interactions between FOH and her physician, and she has presented no evidence of a hostile work environment, her harassment claim is without merit.

2. The Plaintiff's Retaliation Claim Fails as a Matter of Law
Riemensnyder's complaint also alleges that Paragon retaliated against her for exercising a reasonable request for accommodations under the ADA in terminating her employment. We disagree.
The standard for ADA retaliation claims is well established in the Third Circuit:
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show: (1) protected employee activity; (2) adverse action by the employer either after or contemporaneous with the employee's protected activity; and (3) a causal connection between the employee's protected activity and the employer's adverse action ... [*39]  If an employee establishes a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, the burden shifts to the employer to advance a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its adverse employment action.
Krouse v. American Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 500 (3d Cir. 1997) (citations omitted).
In turning to the prima facie case, it is true that a request for accommodations is a protected employee activity under the ADA. See Sulima v. Tobyhanna Army Depot, 602 F.3d 177, 188 (3d Cir. 2010) ("Prohibited discrimination under the ADA includes retaliation against an employee for requesting an accommodation"). But, as previously discussed, the plaintiff has presented no evidence to demonstrate that she requested any accommodation.
In her response to the defendant's motion, the plaintiff also presents the somewhat circular argument that her claim for retaliation is based upon Paragon's refusal to permit her to return to work and to honor her doctor's note, apparently arguing that the protected activity was her request to be returned to her position. But, beyond the plaintiff's bare assertion that Paragon's failure to allow her to return to work was retaliation, the plaintiff has presented no evidence to demonstrate her termination was based upon anything other than FOH's determination that she was medically unfit to perform the duties [*40]  of CSO. Since it is well settled that, "a party resisting a [Rule 56] motion cannot expect to rely merely upon bare assertions, conclusory allegations or suspicions," Gans, 762 F.2d at 341, the plaintiff has failed to meet her burden in resisting the motion for summary judgment on this claim.2

3. The Plaintiff's Gender Discrimination Claim Fails as a Matter of Law
Finally, the plaintiff asserts a claim of gender discrimination under Title VII, arguing that she was treated less favorably than her male counterparts since they were permitted to return to work while she was not.
Title VII prohibits employment discrimination based on an individual's sex or gender. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). To establish a prima facie case of gender-based employment discrimination under Title VII, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: "(1) s/he is a member of a protected class; (2) s/he was qualified for the position s/he sought to attain or retain; (3) s/he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) the action occurred under circumstances that could give rise to an inference of intentional discrimination." Makky v. Chertoff, 541 F.3d 205, 214 (3d Cir. 2008); see also Jones v. Se. Pa. Trans. Auth., 796 F.3d 323 (3d Cir. 2015); Pivirotto v. Innovative Sys., Inc., 191 F.3d 344, 348 n.1, 352, 356, 357 (3d Cir. 1999). The requirements of the prima facie standard are "flexible." Pivirotto, 191 F.3d at 357, and an inference of discrimination may be developed "in a number of ways, including, [*41]  but not limited to, comparator evidence," or other evidence of similar discrimination towards other employees. See Selvato v. Se. Pa. Trans. Auth., 143 F. Supp. 3d 257, 2015 WL 6181351, *6 (E.D. Pa. 2015) (citing Golod v. Bank of Am. Corp., 403 F. App'x 699, 702 n.2 (3d Cir. 2010)).
If a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, then "the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action." Id. If the defendant meets that test, a plaintiff may nevertheless prevail by showing that "the defendant's proffered reason is merely pretext for intentional discrimination." Id. A plaintiff can meet this burden by coming forward with evidence "from which a factfinder could reasonably either (1) disbelieve the employer's articulated legitimate reasons; or (2) believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the employer's action." Burton v. Teleflex Inc., 707 F.3d 417, 427 (3d Cir. 2013) (quoting Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir. 1994)).
Under that first approach, evidence sufficient to allow a factfinder to disbelieve the employer's legitimate reasons requires a plaintiff to show "such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons" that a jury could find that the employer did not actually act for non-discriminatory reasons. Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 765. A plaintiff [*42]  cannot merely show that the employer's decision was "wrong or mistaken," because the issue is the employer's motivation - not whether the decision was sound. Id. Moreover, the plaintiff must point to inconsistencies that would be significant enough to discredit the logic of the proffered legitimate reason. Id.; see also Schroder v. Pleasant Valley Sch. Dist., 458 F. App'x 128, 130 (3d Cir. 2012).
Under the second approach, a plaintiff may come forward with evidence that would show that the employer treated similarly situated comparators more favorably. In order to demonstrate discrimination by showing comparators, "comparator employees must be similarly situated in all relevant respects," the determination of which "takes into account factors such as the employees' job responsibilities, the supervisors and decision-makers, and the nature of the misconduct engaged in." Wilcher v. Postmaster Gen., 441 F. App'x 879, 882 (3d Cir. 2011). It is not necessary to show that misconduct in which employees engaged was identical since comparators who committed offenses that were of "comparable seriousness" may satisfy a plaintiff's burden. Opsatnik v. Norfolk S. Corp., 335 F. App'x 220, 223 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting Wright v. Murray Guard, Inc., 455 F.3d 702, 710 (7th Cir. 2006)). Sometimes, however, the circumstances of a plaintiff's misconduct may justify treating him differently than similar comparators. See George v. Lehigh Valley Health Network, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51690, 2014 WL 1464327, *4 (E.D. Pa. April 15, 2014). Additionally, the Third Circuit has instructed that [*43]  although "identification of one or two comparators may be sufficient at the prima facie stage of analysis, it is not sufficient at the pretext stage." Ray v. Pinnacle Health Hospitals, Inc., 416 F. App'x 157, 164 (3d Cir. 2010) (citing Simpson v. Kay Jewelers, 142 F.3d 639, 645-46 (3d Cir. 1998)).
In this case, we find that Riemensnyder has failed to come forward with sufficient evidence to make out a prima facie case of gender discrimination and find further that the plaintiff has not effectively demonstrated that there exists a genuine issue of material fact that Paragon's proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Riemensnyder's employment was pretextual.
At the outset, the evidence shows that Riemensnyder fails the second prong of the prima facie test because she was not medically qualified for the position of CSO. Riemensnyder failed to meet the USMS standards required for the position of CSO - a condition of her employment which Riemensnyder agreed to in her contract.
Further, as noted above, the fourth prong of the prima facie test requires that a plaintiff show that "similarly situated" employees were treated differently. But here the employees to whom Riemensnyder compares herself were not similarly situated to her. Similarly situated employees are those who have "dealt with the same supervisor, [*44]  were subject to the same standards, and had engaged in similar conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances as would distinguish their conduct or the employer's treatment of them." Opsatnik, 335 F. App'x at 223.
The evidence is clear that the two male CSOs Riemensnyder uses as comparators, Timothy Keiper and David Wehrer, were not similarly situated to Riemensnyder. As previously discussed, not only did CSO Keiper suffer a vastly different medical issue than Riemensnyder, but he was also subject to the same medical determination process as Riemensnyder upon his return from medical leave and was found to be medically qualified to return under those standards. As to CSO Wehrer, the plaintiff has provided only one page of a Medical Review Form as evidence, stating that Wehrer's stress test demonstrated reduced exercise capacity due to a reduced fitness level but that he did not have any medical conditions likely to hinder safe and efficient performance of essential job functions. (Doc. 100-3, at 45). Further, as the defendant points out, Wehrer was found to be medically qualified by FOH, and his medical review decision was performed by a different reviewing medical officer.
In sum, there is simply [*45]  no evidence on the record giving rise to an inference that the reason for Riemensnyder's termination was due to her disability, gender, or in retaliation for her exercising her rights. On the contrary, there is ample evidence that the sole reason Riemensnyder was separated from her position was due to the FOH determination that she was not medically suitable for the job. While it is clear the plaintiff believed she was able to perform at least some of the job duties, it is not within the Court's province to substitute Riemensnyder's belief for the objective medical standards employed by USMS in determining the suitability of its CSOs. Without any evidence in the record of discriminatory motive by Paragon, we recommend the defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted as to all the plaintiff's claims.

III. Conclusion
Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT the defendant's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 97) be GRANTED.
The parties are further placed on notice that pursuant to Local Rule 72.3:
Any party may object to a magistrate judge's proposed findings, recommendations or report addressing a motion or matter described in 28 U.S.C. § 636 (b)(1)(B) or making a recommendation for the disposition of [*46]  a prisoner case or a habeas corpus petition within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy thereof. Such party shall file with the clerk of court, and serve on the magistrate judge and all parties, written objections which shall specifically identify the portions of the proposed findings, recommendations or report to which objection is made and the basis for such objections. The briefing requirements set forth in Local Rule 72.2 shall apply. A judge shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made and may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge. The judge, however, need conduct a new hearing only in his or her discretion or where required by law, and may consider the record developed before the magistrate judge, making his or her own determination on the basis of that record. The judge may also receive further evidence, recall witnesses or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.
