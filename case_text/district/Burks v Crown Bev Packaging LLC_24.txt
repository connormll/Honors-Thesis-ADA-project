Opinion


ORDER ON DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [51]
THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. #51]. The Court previously denied the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. #48]. In doing so, the Court rejected the plaintiff's assertion that the defendant, as a matter of law, failed to participate in good faith in the interactive process toward an agreed reasonable accommodation. The Court observed that there was plenty of process and a lot of interaction between the parties. They discussed extensively Burks' illness and Crown's regretful decision that the plant was too dangerous for Burks to continue in his job as a night [*2]  supervisor.
As for the current motion, the Court has reviewed all of the material and was aided by the oral argument. The Court has labored and stewed far too long to reach a result on the merits. Regrettably, the Court reaches the same conclusion on this motion as it did on the Plaintiff's. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. #51] is DENIED.
The Court is sympathetic to the dilemma presented to the employer by the obvious interaction of the plant's electromagnetic energy-emitting equipment with Burks' Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverters Defibrillator (ICD). The interaction has the potential to harm, even kill, Burks. The Court is also moved by the hard-luck story of Burks' health issues and the double-whammy of losing a job he very much enjoyed. At the same time, the court bristles at the rhetoric of accusation and slander that is so-often invited by the established law of the workplace. Not everyone is a bigot or penurious skin flint. The issues central to this dispute are legitimate and will require thoughtful consideration by the trier of fact. Foremost among them are as follows:
• Whether Plaintiff can perform the essential functions of his job as a Shift Supervisor, [*3]  with or without reasonable accommodation;
• Whether Burks' ICD posed a direct threat to his life while at work;
• Whether an effective accommodation for the perceived risks could have been implemented.
The parties will coordinate with the Court's Deputy Clerk to find a trial date as soon as practicable, given the existing commitments.
Dated this 2nd day of November, 2018.
