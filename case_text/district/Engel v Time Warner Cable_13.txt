Opinion



CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings (In Chambers): Order GRANTING Defendant's motion for summary judgment.
Before the Court is Defendant Charter Communications LLC's ("Defendant") motion for summary judgment or, alternatively, partial summary judgment. See Dkt. # 28 ("Mot."). Plaintiff Jack Engel ("Plaintiff") opposes the motion, see Dkt. # 57 ("Opp."), and Defendant timely replied, see Dkt. # 72 ("Reply"). The Court finds the matter appropriate for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. After considering the moving papers, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion.
I. Background
A. Plaintiff's Employment with Defendant
This is an employment discrimination case. Plaintiff began working for Defendant as a direct service representative ("DSR") in 2006. See Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Facts, Dkt. # 30 ("DSUF"), ¶ 3. Plaintiff had mostly positive reviews in this role. See Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Facts, Dkt. # 58 ("PSUF"), ¶ 54. His duties as a DSR were primarily selling services to residential customers door-to-door, where he would [*2]  spend about 80% of his time outside. See DSUF ¶ 2. Plaintiff also helped with installations, which required lifting cable boxes and making direct connections from the customer's cable box to the line. See id. Aside from a brief stint as a supervisor, Plaintiff remained in the DSR role for the entirety of his employment with Defendant. See id. ¶ 4.
B. Plaintiff's Accident, Resulting Disability, and Restrictions
On October 2, 2015, Plaintiff fell down a flight of stairs at Defendant's Ontario office. See id. ¶ 8. He was found semi-conscious at the bottom of the stairs and was taken to the hospital for five days. See id. Defendant placed Plaintiff on twelve weeks of leave pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") and California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"). See id. ¶ 9. Plaintiff filed a workers' compensation claim and worked with Defendant's workers' comp analyst, Donnie Beverly, regarding his restrictions. See id. ¶ 11. Defendant remained on leave until Plaintiff terminated him in June 2017. See id. ¶ 10.
Plaintiff had both neurological and orthopedic limitations stemming from his injury. In December 2015, Dr. Ghazal, an orthopedic surgeon, examined Plaintiff and deemed him temporarily [*3]  totally disabled, diagnosing him with a "T 12 compression fracture," a PF contusion in his left knee, "rot cuff tendinopathy" in his left shoulder, and post-concussion syndrome. See id. ¶ 13. In May 2016, Dr. Saeed Nick, Plaintiff's primary care physician and neurologist, said that Plaintiff could return to work so long as he did not lift over fifteen pounds, avoided exposure to sunlight, and avoided work in light more generally. See PSUF ¶ 59. Dr. Nick continued to recommend these restrictions until August 2016, when he restricted Plaintiff to "work inside building with no sun exposure work in dim light 10 min break after one-hour work." See id. ¶ 62. Dr. Nick placed these restrictions on Plaintiff through June 2017 because he had sensitivity to light and sound, which triggered headaches. See DSUF ¶ 19. Finally, in January 2017, Dr. Wood, an orthopedist, precluded Plaintiff from "performing repetitive at or above shoulder level activities, from heavy work for the back and from repetitive squatting and climbing." See id. ¶¶ 15-16.
C. Plaintiff's Leave and Termination
In July 2016, Beverly began having discussions with Plaintiff's supervisors about him returning to work on some sort of [*4]  light duty. See PSUF ¶ 68. A supervisor ultimately concluded that because of the summer, they could not accommodate him in his position as a door-to-door DSR given his restrictions around working outside. See id. ¶ 69. In September 2016, Beverly again reached out to Plaintiff's supervisors about "bringing [Plaintiff] back on a trial basis," but there is no record of any follow-up to this conversation. See id. ¶ 72. During this period, Plaintiff spoke to Beverly often and expressed a desire to return to work. See DSUF ¶ 11; PSUF ¶ 75. Plaintiff offered to work as a DSR at night or indoors, or in jobs other than the DSR position until he was ready, such as in the warehouse or call center. See PSUF ¶ 88. In January 2017, Kasei Reed, a senior HR generalist, reached out to Beverly for an update on Plaintiff's status. See DSUF ¶¶ 28-29. Beverly replied that based on the reports from Dr. Nick and Dr. Wood, Defendant could not bring Plaintiff back for any position at that time. See id. ¶¶ 30-31.
In April 2017, Reed sent an email to Beverly and others on the HR team asking to speak about Plaintiff. See PSUF ¶ 90. Reed specifically wanted to know "if we have done the ADA interactive process . [*5]  . . if not I will need to send my manager [] an email summarizing their claim so we can potentially get them off our books." See id. On May 11, 2017, Stacia Erway, Defendant's Director of HR, sent an email to several HR managers with a list of employees on leave and a proposal of what to do with each them. See id. ¶ 92. The note for Plaintiff was "leave exhaustion letter." See Plaintiff's Appendix, Dkt. # 57-7 ("Pl.'s Appx."), Ex. 110 at 11.
The next day, Defendant sent Plaintiff what it describes as a 21-day notice letter or 21-day letter. See PSUF ¶ 94. The letter instructed Plaintiff to either return to work by June 2, 2017 or provide information regarding his need for additional accommodations. See DSUF ¶ 36. Specifically, the letter states that "[y]ou must return the completed Physicians Certification and consent for release of Medical Information back to me within 15 calendar days from the date of this letter or until close of business on May 27, 2017." See Declaration of Jack Engel, Dkt. # 57-1 ("Engel Decl."), Ex. A ("Letter"), at 1. Plaintiff received the letter, but never sent anything back to Defendant. See PSUF ¶¶ 38-39. He testifies that he called both Beverly and Reed, [*6]  but that they did not answer; Defendant disputes whether Plaintiff ever called Reed or Beverly. See DSUF ¶¶ 108-09; PSUF ¶¶ 108-09. Defendant states that in addition to the letter, Reed followed up with Plaintiff via phone, but Plaintiff also disputes that Reed ever called him. See DSUF ¶ 39; PSUF ¶ 39. On June 13, 2017, Defendant mailed Plaintiff a letter that it was terminating his employment because he was not meeting the company attendance policy after he failed to respond to the letter. See DSUF ¶ 41.
D. Plaintiff Re-Applies To Defendant, But Is Denied
On June 30, 2017, Plaintiff returned to Dr. Nick, who ended all of his work restrictions except for a lifting restriction of up to twenty-five pounds. See PSUF ¶ 112. Plaintiff applied for another position as a DSR in September 2017. See id. ¶ 114. Paula Barton, a recruiter for Defendant, reached out to Reed because Barton had heard that he was pursuing legal action and was previously unhappy at his job. See id. She also asked if he was "an ADA accommodation situation?" See id. Reed responded "[w]e say no thank you to this one." See id. In February 2018, Plaintiff reapplied to work for Defendant as a direct sales supervisor at its [*7]  Riverside location. See DSUF ¶ 49. Defendant states that the hiring manager called Plaintiff to set up an interview and left a voicemail, as well as sent a calendar invitation to Plaintiff's email address, but that Plaintiff never responded or showed up to the interview; Plaintiff disputes that he ever received a call or email. See id.; PSUF ¶ 49.
E. Procedural History
On May 25, 2018, Plaintiff filed this action in San Bernardino County Superior Court. See Notice of Removal, Dkt. # 1 ("NOR"), ¶ 1. On October 3, 2018, Plaintiff filed his First Amended Complaint ("FAC"), see Dkt. # 1-3 ("FAC"), alleging the following six causes of action:
First Cause of Action: Discrimination in Violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"). Id. ¶¶ 15-20.
Second Cause of Action: Violation of the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"). Id. ¶¶ 21-27.
Third Cause of Action: Retaliation in Violation of the FEHA. Id. ¶¶ 28-33.
Fourth Cause of Action: Failure to Accommodate in Violation of the FEHA. Id. ¶¶ 34-38.
Fifth Cause of Action: Failure to Engage in the Good Faith Interactive Process in Violation of the FEHA. Id. ¶¶ 39-43.
Sixth Cause of Action: Failure to Prevent Discrimination in Violation [*8]  of the FEHA. Id. ¶¶ 44-47.
Defendant was never served with the original complaint, and was not served with the FAC until December 12, 2018. See NOR ¶ 6. On January 11, 2019, Defendant removed the action to this Court. See generally id.
In April 2019, the Court set the discovery cutoff in the case for November 26, 2019, the final pretrial conference for February 3, 2020, and trial for February 18, 2020. See Scheduling Order, Dkt. # 18. On December 10, 2019, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application asking the Court to re-open discovery and strike Defendant's summary judgment motion for failure to follow Local Rule 7-3. See Dkt. # 40 ("App."). After communicating with Defendant about discovery throughout the summer and fall, Plaintiff alleged that Defendant identified several previously unknown witnesses and produced thousands of pages of discovery immediately before and even after the discovery cutoff. See App. 2:4-12. Plaintiff also alleged that Defendant did not meet and confer pursuant to Local Rule 7-3 before filing its motion for summary judgment. See generally id. The Court denied the request to re-open discovery because Plaintiff expressed issues with Defendant's discovery conduct long before the discovery [*9]  cutoff, but did not file a motion or otherwise seek relief. See Dkt. # 43. Further, the Court held that a decision on the failure to follow Local Rule 7-3 was not a valid basis for ex parte relief. See id.
Defendant now moves for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims. See generally Mot.
II. Legal Standard
"A party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought. The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).
A party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the pleadings and discovery responses that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the nonmoving party will have the burden of proof at trial, the movant can prevail by pointing out that there is an absence of evidence to support the moving party's case. See id. If the moving party meets its initial burden, the nonmoving party must set forth, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Rule 56, "specific facts [*10]  showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
In judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence. Rather, it draws all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987). The evidence presented by the parties must be admissible. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). Conclusory, speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact and defeat summary judgment. See Thornhill Publ'g Co. v. Gen. Tel. & Elecs. Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979).
III. Discussion
A. Procedural Issues: Rule 7-3
First, Plaintiff argues that the Court should deny Defendant's motion due to Defendant's failure to comply with the meet and confer requirements of Central District Local Rule 7-3. See Opp. 17-18. Local Rule 7-3 requires that the parties meet and confer at least seven days prior to the filing of any motion. See L.R. 7-3. Plaintiff contends that the parties did not meet and confer before Defendant filed this motion. See Opp. 17-18. In response, Defendant acknowledges that it left a Rule 7-3 statement out of its original moving papers, but argues that it had given Plaintiff's counsel prior notice on several occasions that it planned to file a summary judgment motion before the December 10, 2019 motion filing [*11]  deadline. See Reply 11.
The Court does not find it appropriate to strike Defendant's motion on Rule 7-3 grounds, but it will note that Defendant's unilateral decision to flout the Local Rules is not well taken. Although it appears that a Rule 7-3 meet and confer never took place aside from a brief exchange during Plaintiff's deposition, Plaintiff was not without notice that Defendant was going to file its summary judgment motion. See Opp. 17-18 (citing Declaration of Martin Aarons, Dkt. # 57-2 ("Aarons Decl."), ¶¶ 3-10). In an email dated December 5, 2019, Plaintiff's counsel stated that "Defendant has indicated it will be filing an MSJ, which it may do at any point between today and December 10th." Aarons Decl., Ex. E. Despite the lack of a formal conference, Defendant's filing was not a surprise, and Plaintiff has not identified "a resolution which eliminates the necessity for a [summary judgment] hearing." See L.R. 7-3. While the Court does not find it appropriate to decide this motion based on Defendant's procedural error, the Court admonishes Defendant to ensure compliance with the Local Rules in the future. Any future failure to comply with the Local Rules may result in the imposition of sanctions.1
B. First and Third Causes of Action: Disability Discrimination and Retaliation Under FEHA
The FEHA prohibits employment practices that discriminate against any person because of his disability. Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940(a). On a motion for summary judgment based on discrimination and retaliation claims, the Court applies the burden-shifting scheme articulated by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Aragon v. Republic Silver State Disposal Inc., 292 F.3d 654, 658 (9th Cir. 2002). First, the plaintiff has the "initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination." Department of Fair Emp't & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 745 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1220 (9th Cir. 1998)). To establish a prima facie case, a plaintiff must show: "(1) plaintiff suffers from a disability; (2) plaintiff is a qualified individual; and (3) plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action [e.g., termination of employment] because of the disability." Prue v. Brady Co./San Diego, Inc., 242 Cal. App. 4th 1367, 1378, 196 Cal. Rptr. 3d 68 (2015) (quoting Brundage v. Hahn, 57 Cal. App. 4th 228, 236, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 830 (1997)).
After the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to show either that a plaintiff cannot establish an element of the FEHA claim or that there was a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate plaintiff's employment." Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 745 (quoting Avila v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1237, 1247, 82 Cal. Rptr. 3d 440 (2008)). Finally, the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to show that "the employer's showing was untrue or pretextual." Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 746 (quoting Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 225, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999)).
Plaintiff bases his [*13]  disability discrimination and retaliation claims on two adverse employment actions: his termination and Defendant's refusal to rehire him. On termination, the Court holds that Plaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case because he is not a "qualified individual," and, even if he could, he has not rebutted Defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason with substantial evidence of pretext. On refusal to rehire, the Court also holds that Plaintiff has not rebutted Defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons with substantial evidence of pretext.

i. Qualified Individual
Plaintiff has not raised a triable issue on his disability discrimination or retaliation claims based on termination because he was not a "qualified individual" under the second prong of the prima facie case. See Prue, 242 Cal. App. 4th at 1378. A qualified individual is "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." Brundage, 57 Cal. App. 4th at 235. An "essential function" refers to "the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires." Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff is not a qualified individual, [*14]  for the DSR position or any other job, because his restrictions made it impossible for him to perform the essential functions of those jobs. See Mot. 10-13. Namely, the restrictions placed on his time outdoors, in front of screens, and ability to perform physical tasks like lifting rendered him unqualified to either return as a DSR or work in a call center or warehouse. See id. Plaintiff responds that he could perform a DSR's essential functions because Dr. Nick cleared him to go in the sun and drive. See Opp. 20-22. Moreover, according to Plaintiff, neither his weight restriction nor his other orthopedic restrictions were essential to the job. See id. Lastly, Plaintiff argues that Defendant improperly forced him to remain on leave even though it erroneously assumed that it could not accommodate his restrictions. See id. 22:15-18.
Plaintiff's claim fails because there is no genuine dispute that he was unable to perform the essential functions of the DSR job, or any job that Defendant could offer him. The Court first addresses the DSR job. According to the 21-day letter, which Plaintiff does not dispute, a DSR's essential functions include frequent computer use and time outdoors. See [*15]  Letter. Plaintiff could not perform these essential functions because, through at least June 2017, Dr. Nick instructed him to work inside with dim lighting and without sun exposure. See DSUF ¶ 19. Although Plaintiff argues that Defendant could have assigned him to "light duty" or alternative hours, these arguments fail because Plaintiff provides no evidence, other than his own speculation, that Defendant had "light duty," evening, or exclusively indoor DSR positions available. See PSUF ¶ 88. As such, Plaintiff was not qualified as a matter of law.
Moreover, the Court finds that Plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of any alternative job that he proposes. Plaintiff offered to work in either Defendant's warehouse or its call center. See id. However, the warehouse technician position had high physical demands, such as repetitive bending, squatting, and lifting, as well as pushing and pulling up to eighty pounds, in a loud environment. See DSUF ¶ 33. Plaintiff's undisputed fifteen-pound weight restriction alone disqualified him from that job. See id. ¶ 19. The call center job's essential functions were similarly unsuitable. Call center employees frequently work with computers [*16]  which would expose Plaintiff to light and, according to Dr. Nick, trigger migraines. See id. As such, Plaintiff's attempt to meet the second prong of the prima facie case using the availability of these jobs also fails.
Plaintiff's argument that Defendant improperly forced him to remain on leave is without merit. See Opp. 22:15-18. In deciding not to bring Plaintiff back until he did not have any restrictions, Defendant relied, in part, on the undisputed testimony of Dr. Nick, who Plaintiff asserts was his primary physician. See DSUF ¶¶ 19-25. Dr. Nick instructed Plaintiff to work inside with dim lighting and without sun exposure, restrictions that were incompatible with the DSR role. See id. ¶ 19. Accordingly, Plaintiff is unlike the plaintiff in Wallace, a case upon which he relies, because here Defendant did not have a "mistaken belief" about Plaintiff's restrictions given that they relied on his physician's undisputed assessment. Wallace v. Cty. of Stanislaus, 245 Cal. App. 4th 109, 133, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 462 (2016) ("As a result of these findings, what County describes as legitimate business reasons actually were erroneous reasons based on County's mistaken belief about Wallace's ability to perform his job safely."). As such, Plaintiff's argument fails.

ii. Legitimate, [*17]  Non-Discriminatory Reason
Even if Plaintiff could establish a prima facie case on either adverse action, Defendant has provided a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for taking those actions. Once Plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to Defendant to provide a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate plaintiff's employment [or re-hire him]." Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 745. It has done so, explaining that Plaintiff failed to reply to the 21-day letter as instructed. Mot. 14:4-15:10. Plaintiff does not dispute that this constitutes a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, instead moving directly into his arguments that this reason was pretextual. See Opp. 22. Accordingly, the Court will also move to this portion of the McDonnell Douglas analysis.

iii. Untrue or Pretextual
Because Defendant has provided a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Plaintiff's termination and the decision not to rehire him, he must now demonstrate that the company's "showing was untrue or pretextual." Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 746.
To overcome the legitimate reasons put forth by Defendant, Plaintiff's "evidence must be both specific and substantial." Aragon, 292 F.3d at 659 (emphasis in original). He "must demonstrate such weaknesses, [*18]  implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence." Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 746. Although "the same evidence [] used to establish a prima facie case" can be used to establish pretext, the Ninth Circuit has held that "the establishment of a prima facie case based on the minimum evidence necessary to raise a presumption of discrimination does not preclude summary judgment." Coleman v. Quaker Oats Co., 232 F.3d 1271, 1282 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Schuler v. Chronicle Broad. Co. Inc., 793 F.2d 1010, 1011 (9th Cir. 1986) ("To withstand an employer's motion for summary judgment in a discrimination suit, the employee must do more than establish a prima facie case and deny the credibility of the employer's witnesses.").
Plaintiff argues that Defendant's nondiscriminatory reason functioned as pretext for both firing him and for refusing to re-hire him. See generally Opp. The Court takes each adverse employment action in turn.

a. Termination
Plaintiff argues that Defendant's proffered reason for firing him is both untrue and pretextual. Plaintiff, citing to his deposition, disputes that he did not respond to the letter because he called Reed and Beverly after receiving it, but neither of them responded. [*19]  See Opp. 22:25; PSUF ¶ 108-09. Plaintiff contends that the real reason he was terminated was because Defendant sought to get all employees on leave, including Plaintiff, "off their books." See Opp. 23:28. In support, Plaintiff cites to internal emails where Defendant's HR personnel discussed the status of those on leave and began assembling Plaintiff's termination paperwork before the letter reply deadline had passed. See id. 23:1-6. Defendant responds that Plaintiff's only evidence of his response to the letter is his self-serving testimony. See Reply 6:3-12. Moreover, according to Defendant, the emails do not reveal a plot to fire all employees on leave, but instead discuss the 21-day letter procedures and follow-up actions if employees do not respond to the notice. See id. 5:12-6:2.
The Court concludes that Plaintiff has not demonstrated pretext, first because he did not respond to the letter as instructed and provides no reason for not doing so. The letter is unmistakably clear that "[Plaintiff] must return the completed Physicians Certification and consent for release of Medical Information back to [Defendant] within 15 calendar days from the date of this letter or until close [*20]  of business on May 27, 2017." See Letter. Plaintiff does not dispute that he failed to do this, and even submitted with his declaration a copy of the letter with the blank forms attached. See id. The letter states that Defendant's "goal is to return you to work in a safe and healthy environment." Id. While Plaintiff argues that he sought to end his leave and return to work, he does not offer any explanation or evidence for why he did not comply with Defendant's instructions to return the forms it requested in the letter.
Plaintiff does not provide substantial evidence that he responded to the letter. Plaintiff asserts that he called Beverly and Reed after receiving the letter, but this "is based solely on his own uncorroborated, self-serving testimony." See PSUF ¶¶ 108-09 (citing Deposition of Jack Engel, ("Engel Dep."), 196:6-15, 196:16-197:4; Jefferson v. Boeing Co., No. CV 13-4453 PSG (SSX), 2014 WL 12692955, at *9 (C.D. Cal. June 16, 2014)). That testimony is insufficient to establish a genuine issue of fact that would preclude summary judgment. See Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1061 (9th Cir. 2002) ("[T]his court has refused to find a 'genuine issue' where the only evidence presented is 'uncorroborated and self-serving' testimony.") (citations omitted); King v. United Parcel Service, 152 Cal. App. 4th 426, 433, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 359 (2007); see also Tomada v. Home Depot U.S.A., [*21]  Inc., No. 13-CV-1647 YGR, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76343, 2014 WL 2538792, at *12 (N.D. Cal. June 3, 2014) (following King, 152 Cal. App. 4th at 433). Moreover, even taking Plaintiff's testimony that he called Reed and Beverly as true, Plaintiff fails to explain how this was responsive to the letter's clear directive to send forms by the end of May 2017.
Lastly, the Court agrees with Defendant that the emails are not substantial evidence of a larger plot to discriminate against those with disabilities, as Plaintiff asserts. The main email that Plaintiff cites, sent between members of Defendant's HR team, asks to know "if we have done the ADA interactive process" with Plaintiff and another employee to see if "we can potentially get them off our books." See PSUF ¶ 90. The Court agrees with Plaintiff that Defendant's use of "get them off our books" is callous, but it does not find that it rises to the level of pretext. For one, in the same email the parties discuss engaging in the interactive process with Plaintiff by sending him a 21-day letter. See id. Defendant sent him this letter, and Plaintiff cites to no evidence that Defendant would have ignored his letter had he responded.
As such, because Plaintiff has not responded with substantial evidence of pretext to Defendant's legitimate reason for terminating [*22]  him, his argument that he was discriminated or retaliated against in his termination fails.

b. Failure to Re-Hire
Plaintiff also briefly argues that Defendant used his failure to respond to the letter as pretext for rejecting his applications for other positions after his termination. See Opp. 25:19-26. In support, Plaintiff cites an email exchange among Defendant's HR team where Reed said "we say no thank you to this one" after he applied to a position. See PSUF ¶ 114. The Court disagrees. The email that Plaintiff cites to included a discussion of Plaintiff's unhappiness in his prior position and that he was litigious. See id. However, other than Plaintiff's speculation that Defendant was retaliating against him based on his disability, Plaintiff does not provide substantial evidence that any hiring decision was motivated by factors other than his prior record with Defendant. See King, 152 Cal. App. 4th at 433 ("Moreover, plaintiff's subjective beliefs in an employment discrimination case do not create a genuine issue of fact; nor do uncorroborated and self-serving declarations.").
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment on Plaintiff's first and third causes of action.
C. Second Cause of Action: Violation of [*23]  the CFRA
To prove CFRA interference, a plaintiff must show that the defendant interfered with his substantive CFRA rights, which include (1) the right to take up to twelve weeks of leave for a qualifying purpose, and (2) the right to reinstatement to the same or comparable position. Cal. Gov't. Code § 12945.2(a), (c)(3)(A); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11089(a). Here, Plaintiff took eighty-seven weeks of leave without interference from Defendant. See DSUF ¶ 10. His initial twelve weeks of leave were covered under CFRA. See id. ¶ 9. Plaintiff did not oppose Defendant's motion on this claim. See generally Opp. Because Plaintiff does not dispute that he took this leave without interference, and that he was ineligible for reinstatement under the statute because he did not return within the initial twelve weeks, this claim fails.
As such, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's second cause of action.
D. Fourth Cause of Action: Failure to Accommodate Under FEHA
The elements of a reasonable accommodation cause of action are that (1) the plaintiff suffered a disability, (2) he could perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation, and (3) the defendant failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability. [*24]  Wilson v. Cty. of Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1192, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439 (2009).
Defendant contends that Plaintiff's claim fails because he could not perform essential functions of any job he sought due to his medical restrictions. See Mot. 20-21. Defendant also argues that it did provide Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation: a leave of absence. See id. 21-22. Plaintiff responds that he could do the essential functions of the DSR job because Dr. Nick cleared him to go in the sun and drive. See Opp. 21:7-15. Moreover, according to Plaintiff, neither his weight restriction nor his other orthopedic restrictions were essential to the job. See id.
As with Plaintiff's discrimination claim, his failure to accommodate claim fails because there is no genuine dispute that he could perform the essential functions of any available job with a reasonable accommodation. Plaintiff could not complete the essential functions of the DSR job, such as being outdoors and using computers frequently, because Dr. Nick instructed him to work inside with dim lighting and without sun exposure. See DSUF ¶ 19. While Plaintiff offered to work in either Defendant's warehouse or call center, the warehouse technician position had high physical demands, and call center employees frequently work with [*25]  computers which would expose Plaintiff to light and, according to Dr. Nick, trigger migraines. See id.
Plaintiff also mentions other tasks that he could have performed, but these tasks did not add up to an available position. California courts have consistently held that employers are not required to create a new position to reasonably accommodate an employee. See Raine v. City of Burbank, 135 Cal. App. 4th 1215, 1222-26, 37 Cal. Rptr. 3d 899 (2006) ("[A]n employer has no duty . . . to accommodate a disabled employee by making a temporary accommodation permanent if doing so would require the employer to create a new position just for the employee[.]"); see also Spitzer v. Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 1389, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000) ("The responsibility to reassign a disabled employee who cannot be otherwise accommodated does not require creating a new job, moving another employee, promoting the disabled employee, or violating another employee's rights under a collective bargaining agreement.") (internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff provides several examples of tasks he could have performed, such as cleaning or searching for products or answering customer complaints. See PSUF ¶ 81. But beyond Plaintiff's own speculation, there is no evidence indicating that Defendant had vacant positions for which Plaintiff might have been suited [*26]  with his medical restrictions, and Defendant was under no obligation to create such a position. See Raine, 135 Cal. App. 4th at 1222.
Lastly, Defendant reasonably accommodated Plaintiff's disability with a leave of absence. See DSUF ¶¶ 9-10. After Plaintiff's initial FMLA leave expired on December 25, 2015, Defendant kept Plaintiff on leave until June 2, 2017. See id. Courts have found that a leave of absence can be an acceptable form of a reasonable accommodation, see, e.g., Hanson, 74 Cal. App. 4th at 226. However, while "[a] finite leave of absence may be a reasonable accommodation to allow an employee time to recover . . . FEHA does not require the employer to provide an indefinite leave of absence to await possible future vacancies." See Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 377-78, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015). Plaintiff has not presented any evidence to suggest that there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether his leave of absence was a reasonable accommodation under the circumstances.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment on the fourth cause of action.
E. Fifth Cause of Action: Failure to Engage in FEHA Interactive Process and Sixth Cause of Action: Failure to Prevent Discrimination under FEHA
The interactive process required under the FEHA is "an informal process with the employee [*27]  or the employee's representative, to attempt to identify a reasonable accommodation that will enable the employee to perform the job effectively." Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1013, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009) (quoting Wilson, 169 Cal. App. 4th at 1195). To prevail on a claim for failure to engage in an interactive process, the plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) he has a disability; (2) he requested a reasonable accommodation for his disability; and (3) the defendant failed to engage in a timely, good faith interactive process with him. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). To prevail, "an employee must identify a reasonable accommodation that would have been available at the time the interactive process should have occurred." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1018-19; see also Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 980-83, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to create a triable issue on this cause of action because it engaged in the interactive process with Plaintiff. See Mot. 22-24. As evidence, Defendant points to that fact that it gave Plaintiff leave for over a year, Plaintiff's claim that he talked with Beverly between seven and ten times while on that leave, and the 21-day letter prior to terminating him. See id. Plaintiff counters that Defendant did not contact him on its own between June 2016 and May 2017. See Opp. 25:8-12. Instead, he initiated every contact with them up until the [*28]  21-day letter. See id. 7:13-17.
It is undisputed that Defendant granted Plaintiff's request for a leave of absence. DSUF ¶¶ 9-10. Dr. Nick evaluated Plaintiff numerous times and each time Plaintiff was given medical restrictions preventing him from performing his job. See id. ¶ 19; PSUF ¶¶ 59, 62. Further, Plaintiff recalls discussing his work restrictions with Beverly between seven and ten times in 2016 and 2017. DSUF ¶ 11. Beverly informed him that Defendant would welcome him back to work once he was free of restrictions. PSUF ¶ 76. Therefore, Defendant has presented sufficient evidence that it engaged in a process with Plaintiff to identify a reasonable accommodation in good faith. Moreover, as discussed above, Defendant has shown that there is no evidence to suggest that reasonable accommodations other than granting Plaintiff's request for a leave of absence were available. The burden has thus shifted to Plaintiff to point to evidence that creates a genuine issue of fact as to whether Defendant violated its duty to engage in the interactive process or whether there were other reasonable accommodations available at the time the interactive process should have occurred, but Plaintiff [*29]  has failed to do so.
Plaintiff's argument that there is a genuine dispute because Defendant never initiated contact with him fails. See Opp. 25:8-12. As an initial matter, "[t]he employee must initiate the process unless the disability and resulting limitations are obvious. Where the disability, resulting limitations, and necessary reasonable accommodations, are not open, obvious, and apparent to the employer, . . . the initial burden rests primarily upon the employee . . . to specifically identify the disability and resulting limitations, and to suggest the reasonable accommodations." See Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1013 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In this case, Plaintiff cannot create a genuine dispute simply because he initiated contact. Moreover, Defendant continuously engaged in the interactive process when it sent the 21-day letter. See PSUF ¶ 94; Humphrey v. Memorial Hosps. Ass'n., 239 F.3d 1128, 1138 (9th Cir. 2001). Although Plaintiff states that he called Reed and Beverly after receiving the letter, Plaintiff did not respond in accordance with the letter's clear instructions. See Letter ("You must return the completed Physicians Certification and consent for release of Medical Information back to me within 15 calendar days from the date of this letter [*30]  or until close of business on May 27, 2017"); DSUF ¶¶ 108-09. Defendant's subsequent decision to terminate Plaintiff does not create a triable issue on whether Defendant engaged in the interactive process.
As such, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's fifth cause of action. Furthermore, because Plaintiff's sixth cause of action, failure to prevent discrimination under FEHA, is derivative of Plaintiff's now-dismissed discrimination claims, the Court also GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment on that claim as well.
IV. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment on each of Plaintiff's causes of action.
This order closes the case.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
