Opinion



ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
THIS CAUSE comes before the Court on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment ("Defendant's Motion") [ECF No. 52] filed on October 15, 2019. Defendant contends that it is entitled to summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181, et seq. Having reviewed the parties' submissions, the record, and being otherwise fully advised in the premises, it is hereby
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 52] is GRANTED as explained herein.

BACKGROUND1
Plaintiff Stanislav Zalezhnev was employed for three months as a maintenance and security guard at Wonderworld Montessori Academy ("Academy"), which is operated by Defendant. See Defendants' Statement of Material Facts ("Def. SOMF") [ECF No. 51] ¶ 1-2, 57; Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts ("Pl. SOMF") [ECF No. 57] ¶ 1-2. Plaintiff's position required him to use a leaf blower, pick [*2]  up tree debris and garbage, shampoo the carpets in the classrooms with heavy equipment, clean the animal cages, run errands, and assist parents and children at arrival and dismissal by operating non-motorized school gates that required pushing and pulling. Pl. SOMF ¶¶ 45-50; Stanislav Zalezhnev Affidavit [ECF No. 56] ¶ 22.
Plaintiff alleges that on multiple occasions he told Camilla Rovshan ("Rovshan"), the President and Owner of the Academy, that he suffered from a physical condition that "impair[ed] his ability to walk, push, pull, bend and lift heavy objects." Pl. SOMF ¶ 64. Plaintiff's condition derives from the "fusion of his neck (cervical) bones" which causes him to suffer from numbness in one of his legs. Pl. SOMF ¶¶ 62-63. Because of this condition, Plaintiff alleges that he had difficulty using the leaf blower, operating the large carpet cleaner, lifting heavy items, and pushing and pulling the non-motorized school gates. Pl. SOMF ¶¶ 63, 68. After Plaintiff told Rovshan of his physical impairments, Rovshan threatened to cut his hours. Zalezhnev Aff. ¶ 21. Similarly, on one occasion, Plaintiff told Rovshan that his back hurt while cleaning the exterior trash, and Rovshan threatened [*3]  to fire him, but she did not do so then. Id. at ¶ 23. On January 12, 2018, Plaintiff told Rovshan that he had a doctor's appointment after work; an altercation ensued between the parties and Plaintiff was ultimately fired. Pl. SOMF ¶¶ 55, 72.
On January 30, 2019, Plaintiff filed the instant action against Defendant Wonderworld Academy Corporation. See Compl. [ECF No. 1]. Plaintiff's Complaint alleges three counts under the ADA: (1) discrimination (Count I); (2) harassment (Count II); and (3) retaliation (Count III). On October 15, 2019, Defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing that no material issues of fact exist in this case, and Defendant is entitled to final judgment in its favor as a matter of law.

LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate where "the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In making this assessment, the Court "must view all the evidence and all factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party," [*4]  Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997) (citation omitted), and "must resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-movant," United of Omaha Life Ins. Co. v. Sun Life Ins. Co. of Am., 894 F.2d 1555, 1558 (11th Cir. 1990) (citation omitted).
The movant's initial burden on a motion for summary judgment "consists of a responsibility to inform the court of the basis for its motion and to identify those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Fitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, 2 F.3d 1112, 1115 (11th Cir. 1993) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). Once the moving party has shouldered its initial burden, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to "'set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial,' not just to 'rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading.'" United States v. Lawrence, 276 F.3d 193, 197 (5th Cir. 2001) (quoting Resolution Trust Corp. v. Camp, 965 F.2d 25, 29 (5th Cir. 1992)).

ANALYSIS

I. Discrimination Claim Under ADA (Count I)
An employer may not discriminate against "a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). To establish a prima facie [*5]  case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he is disabled; (2) he was a qualified individual at the relevant time; and (3) he was discriminated against because of his disability. See Reed v. Heil Co., 206 F. 3d 1055, 1061 (11th Cir. 2000). Because Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that he is "disabled" or a "qualified individual" under the ADA, his claim fails.

A. Disability
The mere presence of an impairment is not, by itself, sufficient to constitute a disability under the ADA. See Standard v. A.B.E.L. Services, Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1327 (11th Cir. 1998). The ADA defines "disability" to mean: (a) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of an individual; (b) a record of such an impairment; or (c) being regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). Here, Plaintiff contends that he has an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities and that he was regarded as having such an impairment. The Court analyzes each of these allegations in turn.

1) Impairment That Substantially Limits One or More Major Life Activities
The Supreme Court has articulated a three-step inquiry for determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity. See Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 631, 118 S. Ct. 2196, 141 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1998). First, the Court must ascertain whether plaintiff suffers from a physical [*6]  or mental "impairment." Although the ADA does not define the term "impairment," the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") has promulgated regulations that define "physical or mental impairment" to include "any physiological disorder or condition...such as...musculoskeletal." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(h).2 Here, Plaintiff alleges that he suffers from numbness radiating down one of his legs, which was caused by a fusion of his neck bones. His musculoskeletal issues are documented in a hospital discharge form, which references a cervical fusion surgery in 2014 and accompanying pain. See Medical Discharge Summary [ECF No. 52-1]. Crediting Plaintiff's version of the facts, and the accompanying medical record, the Court finds that Plaintiff suffers from a physical impairment.
Next, the Court must identify whether the life activity purportedly impacted by Plaintiff's impairment is a "major life activity." Plaintiff contends that his impairment "substantially limited his major life activities, such as walking, and working, bending, and lifting." Comp. ¶ 5. Walking, working, bending, and lifting are all included in the definition of "major life activity" under 42 U.S.C. section 12102(2). As such, the life activities allegedly impacted [*7]  by Plaintiff's impairment constitute "major life activities."
Finally, the Court must determine whether the claimed impairment "substantially limits" that major life activity. "'Substantially limits' means 'prevents or severely restricts' rather than only a 'diminished activity tolerance.'" Roberts v. Rayonier, Inc., 135 F. App'x 351, 356 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting Rossbach v. City of Miami, 371 F.3d 1354, 1358 (11th Cir. 2004)). When determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity, courts evaluate: "(1) the nature and severity of the impairment; (2) the duration or expected duration of the impairment; and (3) the permanent or long term impact, or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment." Gordon v. E.L. Hamm & Assocs., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 911 (11th Cir. 1996).
To prove that his physical impairment substantially limits his ability to walk, work, bend, and lift, Plaintiff relies entirely on his own Affidavit. Plaintiff's Affidavit, however, does not shed light on the nature of his impairment, or more importantly, the extent to which his impairment impacts his major life activities. To rise to the level of a disability, an impairment must "prevent or severely restrict" an individual's major life activities; impairments that result in mild limitations are not considered disabilities for purposes of the ADA. Although the [*8]  Eleventh Circuit has not squarely addressed this issue, it has approvingly cited cases that have held "that someone who walks, sits, stands or sleeps 'moderately below average' is not disabled under the Act." Rossbach, 371 F.3d at 1358 (citing Kelly v. Drexel Univ., 94 F.3d 102, 107 (3d Cir.1996)); accord Harmon v. Sprint United Mgmt. Corp., 264 F. Supp. 2d 964 (D. Kan. 2003).
Here, at most, Plaintiff's Affidavit states that he suffered from a physical condition that made it difficult for him to walk on uneven surfaces, as well as pull, bend, and lift heavy objects. See Zalezhnev Aff. ¶ 9. But the record is bereft of evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that Plaintiff's physical impairment "prevents or severely restricts" his ability to walk, work, bend, or lift. The only medical record before the Court is Plaintiff's Medical Discharge Summary, which indicates Plaintiff had a cervical fusion surgery in 2014. See Medical Discharge Summary. But even that record notes Plaintiff's "postoperative course was unremarkable." Id.
Moreover, Plaintiff's own deposition testimony undermines his claim that he was substantially limited in his major life activities. Plaintiff testified that despite experiencing some physical pain, he was able to continue working and fulfilling his professional obligations. See Zalezhnev Dep. 113:18-21; [*9]  see also D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1227 (11th Cir. 2005) (agreeing with district court's observation that a plaintiff's proven ability to work contradicts her claim that she was substantially limited in the major life activity of working). Thus, no record evidence links Plaintiff's impairment to his alleged limitations on major life activities, and Plaintiff's conclusory allegations are insufficient to withstand summary judgment. See Holton v. First Coast Serv. Options, Inc., 703 F. App'x 917, 921 (11th Cir. 2017) (finding plaintiff's conclusory allegations insufficient to withstand summary judgment and establish a disability).

2) Regarded as Being Impaired
Plaintiff also contends that he was "regarded as having such an impairment" under 42 U.S.C. section 12102(3) such that he qualifies as disabled and satisfies the first prong of the ADA discrimination claim analysis. An individual is "regarded as" disabled if he establishes that he "has been subjected to an action prohibited under this chapter because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(A). Plaintiff's Complaint alleges that Defendant "regarded Zalezhnev as having an impairment that substantially limited his major life activities, such as walking, working, bending, and lifting." Comp. [*10]  ¶ 14. In support of this proposition, Plaintiff cites to his Complaint and Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. See Pl's Opposition [ECF No. 55] at 8-9. But neither of these filings serve as evidence for the proposition that Plaintiff was regarded as being disabled.
Moreover, Plaintiff's Affidavit fares no better. In his Affidavit, Plaintiff notes that although on multiple occasions he told Rovshan that he had a physical impairment, she continued to assign—and he continued to perform—tasks that required moderate physical effort, such as running errands, using a leaf blower, cleaning carpets with heavy equipment, and picking up tree debris. See generally Zalezhnev Aff. However, "the mere fact that an employer is aware of an employee's impairment is insufficient to demonstrate that the employer regarded the employee as disabled." Blundell v. Health Care Auth. of City of Huntsville, 140 F. App'x 154, 156 (11th Cir. 2005) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Here, Plaintiff has provided no evidence beyond his own conclusory statements to support his allegation that Defendant regarded him as being disabled.
In addition, Plaintiff does not identify a prohibited action that he was subjected to because of an actual or perceived physical impairment. While it appears that [*11]  Rovshan may have threatened to cut Plaintiff's hours and to terminate him, she never actually did so before January 2018. And Plaintiff's final termination was, by Plaintiff's own admission, unrelated to any perceived impairment. See Zalezhnev Dep. at 114:2-5 (stating that he was terminated because he was "no longer necessary there" and someone else was replacing him).
In sum, the absence of evidence in this case precludes a reasonable factfinder from concluding that Plaintiff is disabled within the meaning of the ADA. While this alone is fatal to Plaintiff's discrimination claim, the Court nonetheless assesses whether a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff is a "qualified individual" under the ADA.

B. "Qualified Individual" Under the ADA
Even if Plaintiff suffered from a disability, he has failed to advance sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that he is a "qualified individual" under the ADA. As such, his claim for discrimination doubly fails.
An individual is "qualified" if he can perform the essential functions of the job in question with or without reasonable accommodations. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 406, 99 S. Ct. 2361, 60 L. Ed. 2d 980 (1979). An employer discriminates against a qualified individual with a [*12]  disability when the employer fails to provide "reasonable accommodations" for the disability—unless doing so would impose undue hardship on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(a). An accommodation qualifies as "reasonable" only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job. Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001).
"Essential functions" are the fundamental job duties of a position that an individual with a disability is actually required to perform. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)(1). In determining what functions are deemed essential, the ADA directs courts to consider "the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential," such as the written job description. See 42 U.S.C. 12111(8); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3). A job function also may be essential if there are a limited number of employees among whom performance of the job can be distributed. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)(ii); Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997).
To prove a disability discrimination case, an employee bears the burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow him to perform the essential functions of his job. See Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1286; Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 283 (11th Cir. 1997). To identify reasonable accommodations that could overcome a person's limitations, an employer may need to "initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii)(3). But "where an employee fails to identify a reasonable accommodation, [*13]  the employer has no affirmative duty to engage in an 'interactive process' or to show undue hardship." Spears v. Creel, 607 F. App'x 943, 948 (11th Cir. 2015).
Defendant argues the essential functions of the security maintenance position included cleaning school grounds, moving equipment, and operating the school gates. Plaintiff does not advance a position on which activities constituted the "essential functions" of his job. Instead, Plaintiff argues that the jury must determine whether "pushing, pulling, bending and stooping" were essential functions, and whether Plaintiff could perform these activities with or without an accommodation. See Pl's Opposition at 9-13.
Here, it is clear from the record that—at the very least—maintaining clean school grounds and operating the non-motorized gates were essential functions of the security maintenance position Plaintiff occupied. The Academy's Employee Handbook states, in relevant part, that appropriately "operat[ing] all equipment and machinery as necessary" and "maintain[ing] school buildings and grounds in top conditions" were essential functions of the job. See Employee Handbook [ECF No. 51-2]. Moreover, Plaintiff's Complaint—and his deposition testimony—concede that central to his job was a requirement that he operate [*14]  the Academy's non-motorized gates by pushing and pulling them open. See Comp. ¶ 9; Zalezhnev Dep. 87:15-25. Accordingly, the Court finds that maintaining clean school grounds and operating the non-motorized school gates were essential functions of Plaintiff's job.
Plaintiff then argues, albeit convolutedly, that he could not perform the essential functions of his job and thus requested an accommodation.3 Plaintiff maintains that Defendant failed to initiate an "interactive process" to determine a reasonable accommodation that would allow Plaintiff to perform the essential functions of his job. As such, Plaintiff claims that Defendant failed to accommodate him. However, under well-established Eleventh Circuit law, Plaintiff's claims are without merit.
"The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of [his] job rests with [the] employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such accommodation is reasonable." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000); see also Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1286. Furthermore, "where a plaintiff cannot demonstrate 'reasonable accommodation,' the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant." [*15]  Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997). Thus, before an employer has a duty to show undue hardship, the plaintiff first must show that a reasonable accommodation exists. See id. at 286.
Plaintiff has not met his burden of identifying any reasonable accommodation that would have permitted him to perform the essential functions of his job. Although Plaintiff's Opposition repeatedly notes that he requested "an accommodation" or "job alterations," not once does he actually identify the accommodations that would have suited him, or whether they were reasonable or even tenable. "[A]n employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which that employee desires." Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285 (internal quotations and citations omitted). In fact, "[a]n employer is not required by the ADA to reallocate job duties in order to change the essential functions of a job. Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367 (internal citations and quotations omitted). For example, a request to forfeit operating the school gates or stop cleaning the school grounds would require Defendant to change the essential functions of Plaintiff's job and thus would not constitute a reasonable accommodation.
Plaintiff's failure to identify a reasonable accommodation that would permit Plaintiff to perform the essential duties [*16]  of his job is fatal to his ADA claim. Because no reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff was "disabled" or a "qualified individual" under the ADA, his discrimination claim fails.4

II. Harassment and Retaliation Claims Under the ADA (Counts II and III)
Defendant claims that Plaintiff's counts for harassment and retaliation under the ADA are duplicative of his claims for discrimination.5 Plaintiff posits that Defendant has waived any arguments regarding Plaintiff's harassment and retaliation claims by dedicating minimal analysis to these claims in its Motion. While Defendant's arguments in this regard are certainly brief, the Court finds that Defendant has sufficiently explained its argument that "Plaintiff's second and third claims for harassment under the ADA and retaliation under the ADA merely parrot the claims in Plaintiff's ADA discrimination claim." Defendant's Motion at 16.
Moreover, the Court agrees that the acts that form the basis of Plaintiff's claims for harassment and retaliation are virtually indistinguishable from those on which Plaintiff's discrimination claim rests, and thus provide no basis for denying summary judgment on this issue. See [*17]  Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1261 (11th Cir. 2001); accord Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1288 ("[T]he acts Stewart describes relate directly to her 'reasonable accommodation' discrimination claim, not her retaliation claim, and accordingly provide no basis for denying summary judgment on this issue.").
Further, even on the merits, the facts when viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff would not permit a reasonable jury to infer Plaintiff was harassed or retaliated against. With respect to Plaintiff's discrimination claim, because the Court has already determined that he is not "disabled" within the meaning of the ADA, Plaintiff has not established that he is a member of a protected class as required.6 See Gilliard, 500 F. App'x at 870 (noting that a plaintiff who failed to demonstrate that she was disabled within the meaning of the ADA could not establish that she was a member of a protected class).
Additionally, Plaintiff's evidence—his Interrogatory Responses and his Affidavit—fall well short of demonstrating that he was subjected to harassment that was so severe or pervasive that it altered the terms and conditions of his employment. At most, Plaintiff's Affidavit demonstrates that Rovshan yelled at Plaintiff and threatened to fire and cut his hours, but such conduct is more akin [*18]  to isolated offensive utterances than severe or pervasive harassment, as required to make a successful harassment claim. See Schwertfager v. City of Boynton Beach, 42 F. Supp. 2d 1347, 1367 (S.D. Fla. 1999). While Plaintiff may have been subjectively offended by Defendant's conduct, his conclusory allegations, without more, do not provide the quantum of proof necessary to sustain his claims and defeat summary judgment. See id.
Similarly, with respect to Plaintiff's retaliation claim, the record is devoid of any evidence to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.7 Indeed, Plaintiff does not identify the nature of the protected expression, the adverse employment action, or the causal link between the adverse action and the protected expression. Rather, the Complaint states that Plaintiff "opposed the discrimination and harassment inflicted on him" and that "shortly thereafter" Defendant "negatively altered" Plaintiff's duties and eventually fired him. Compl. ¶¶ 31-32. Even if the Court could divine the basis for Plaintiff's retaliation claim, there is simply no evidence in the record that suggests Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action because he engaged in statutorily protected expression.
