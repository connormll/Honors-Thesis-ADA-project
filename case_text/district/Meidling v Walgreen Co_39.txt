Opinion



ORDER
THIS CAUSE is before the Court1 on:
(1) Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Support of its Bill of Costs (Doc. 173), which the Court construes as a motion for taxation of costs, and Plaintiff's response in opposition (Doc. 192);
(2) Plaintiff's Rule 54 and Rule 37(c) Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs on Unpaid Wage Claim (Doc. 177) and Defendant's response in opposition (Doc. 189);
(3) Plaintiff's Motion for Taxation of Costs (Doc. 179) and Defendant's response in opposition (Doc. 190);
(4) Plaintiff's Renewed Motion for Taxation of Costs (Doc. 196);
(5) Plaintiff's Renewed Rule 54 and Rule 37(c) Motion for [*2]  Attorney Fees and Costs on Unpaid Wage Claim (Doc. 197); and
(6) Defendant's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Renewed Motions for Fees and Costs (Doc. 202).

I.
On October 4, 2012, Plaintiff Norman Meidling ("Mr. Meidling") filed an eight-count complaint against Defendant Walgreen Co. ("Walgreens"), alleging several employment-related claims. Five of his eight claims were decided by the court on Walgreens' motions to dismiss and for summary judgment. (See Docs. 9, 77). Plaintiff's claims for failure to provide reasonable accommodation (Count I) and retaliation (Count II), both brought pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq., ("ADA"), and his common law claim for unpaid wages (Count VII) were tried to jury in February 2015.2 At the close of evidence, Defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law on all claims, which the Court denied. Plaintiff moved for judgment as a matter of law on all issues, except the reasonable accommodation claim. The Court denied Plaintiff's motion as to the retaliation claim, but ruled as a matter of law that Plaintiff should prevail on his claim for unpaid wages relating to his last two weeks paycheck. The Court reserved on the matter of damages, if any, [*3]  as well as fees and costs.
On February 23, 2015, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Defendant finding that while Plaintiff was a qualified individual with a disability who had duly notified Walgreens of his disability, Walgreens had not denied him a reasonable accommodation or retaliated against him in violation of the ADA. (Doc. 167). Judgment in favor of Walgreen's was entered on Counts I and II. (Doc. 168). Thereafter, Defendant filed for costs as prevailing party on the ADA claims. (Doc. 173).
Following trial, this Court ordered the parties to file supplemental pleadings regarding any remaining damages to be decided on the unpaid wages claim. (Doc. 169). Plaintiff did not file any motion or pleading for damages, but filed motions for both attorney's fees and costs. (Docs. 177, 179). Since Plaintiff did not seek additional damages, this Court directed that judgment be entered on Count VII, but that no additional damages were to be awarded, and reserved ruling on the matter of fees and costs. (Doc. 193). Judgment was entered on April 15, 2015, in favor of Plaintiff as to Count VII only. (Doc. 194). On May 8, 2015, Plaintiff filed his renewed motions for attorney's fees [*4]  and costs (Docs. 196, 197), which Defendant has moved to strike (Doc. 202).

II.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) provides that costs, other than attorney's fees, "should be allowed to the prevailing party" unless a federal statute, the federal rules, or court order provides otherwise. Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1). This rule creates a presumption in favor of awarding costs to the prevailing party. Arcadian Fertilizer, L.P. v. MPW Indus. Servs., Inc., 249 F.3d 1293, 1296 (11th Cir. 2001) (citing Manor Healthcare Corp. v. Lomelo, 929 F.2d 633, 639 (11th Cir. 1991)). In taxing costs under Rule 54, courts may tax only those costs explicitly authorized by statute. Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U.S. 437, 442, 107 S. Ct. 2494, 96 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1987). Title 28 U.S.C. § 1920 authorizes the taxation of the following costs: (1) fees of the clerk and marshal; (2) fees for printed or electronically recorded transcripts necessarily obtained for use in the case; (3) fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses; (4) fees for exemplification and the costs of making copies of any materials where the copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case; (5) docket fees under § 1923; and (6) compensation of court appointed experts and interpreter services. 28 U.S.C. § 1920.3
Local Rule 4.18 provides as follows:
(a) In accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 54, all claims for costs or attorney's fees preserved by appropriate pleading or pretrial stipulation shall be asserted by separate motion or petition filed not later than fourteen (14) days following the entry of judgment. The pendency [*5]  of an appeal from the judgment shall not postpone the filing of a timely application pursuant to this rule.
M.D. Fla. R. 4.18(a).
Section 448.08, Fla. Stat., provides: "The court may award to the prevailing party in an action for unpaid wages costs of the action and a reasonable attorney's fee." The policy underlying § 448.08 is to provide "a means to equalize the disparate positions of employees in attempting to collect for the fruits of their labors." Tampa Bay Publ'ns, Inc. v. Watkins, 549 So. 2d 745, 747 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1989). This provision does not require the court to award fees to the successful employee in all cases, but only grants the court the discretion to do so. Id.
The Supreme Court has held that a prevailing party is one who prevailed on "any significant issue in the litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing the suit." Tex. State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 791-92, 109 S. Ct. 1486, 103 L. Ed. 2d 866 (1989) (internal citations and quotations omitted). "To be a prevailing party, [a] party need not prevail on all issues to justify a full award of costs, however. Usually the litigant in whose favor judgment is rendered is the prevailing party for purposes of rule 54(d)...." Head v. Medford, 62 F.3d 351, 354 (11th Cir. 1995) (citations omitted).
The law governing attorneys' fees and costs allows that "one party can be determined a prevailing party on one claim, while the opposing party prevails [*6]  on another claim." Stewart v. Town of Zolfo Springs, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20914, 1998 WL 776848, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 16, 1998) (citing Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 435, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1983)); see also James v. Wash Depot Holdings, Inc., 242 F.R.D. 645, 648 (S.D. Fla. 2007). In this case, both parties prevailed on separate and distinct claims — Defendant prevailed on the ADA claims while Plaintiff prevailed on his claim for unpaid wages.

III.

Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Support of its Bill of Costs
By its construed motion for costs, Defendant seeks an award of costs as the prevailing party in this action. (Doc. 173). In particular, Defendant requests costs totaling $14,679.43, comprised of $213.00 for service of summons and subpoenas; $11,022.94 for printed or electronically recorded transcripts; $110.00 in witness fees; and $3,333.49 for exemplification and the costs of making copies. (See Doc. 171).4
Plaintiff objects to Defendant's request for costs claiming that only Plaintiff is the prevailing party entitled to costs due to this Court's granting of directed verdict as to Count VII (the unpaid wages claim). Moreover, Plaintiff appears to object to the amount of costs that Walgreens seeks because it did not prevail on all issues with which the costs are associated. (Doc. 192).
As an initial matter, the Court finds that Defendant is the prevailing party on the ADA claims in Counts I and II by virtue of the jury [*7]  verdict and judgment in its favor. (Docs. 167, 168). As prevailing party, Defendant is entitled to taxable costs.
First, Defendant seeks $213.00 for service of witness subpoenas. Private process server fees may be taxed pursuant to § 1920(1). U.S. E.E.O.C. v. W&O, Inc., 213 F.3d 600, 624 (11th Cir. 2000). Such fees, however, are not to exceed the statutory limits set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1921, i.e. the rate charged by the U.S. Marshal's Service. Id. The Marshal is currently authorized to charge $65.00 per hour for each item personally served, plus travel costs and other out-of-pocket expenses. 28 C.F.R. § 0.114(a)(3).5
Although Defendant attaches the invoices of its private process servers, their hourly rates are not indicated. As such, the Court is permitted to award at a maximum $55.00 for the subpoena to Dr. Spuza-Milord served before October 30, 2013, and $65.00 each for the two subpoenas served after October 30, 2013.
Accordingly, the Court awards Defendants $185.00 for costs associated with the service of subpoenas.
For costs associated with printed or electronically recorded transcripts, Defendant seeks $11,022.94. Section 1920(2) provides for an award for costs of the court reporter for printed or electronically recorded transcripts necessarily obtained for use in the case. Whether the costs for a [*8]  deposition are taxable depends on the factual question of whether the deposition was wholly or partially necessarily obtained for use in the case. Watson v. Lake Cnty., 492 F. App'x 991, 996 (11th Cir. 2012) (stating that use of a deposition in a summary judgment motion tends to show that the deposition was necessarily obtained for use in a case); E.E.O.C., 213 F.3d at 621 ("It is not necessary to use a deposition at trial for it to be taxable, but admission into evidence ... tends to show that it was necessarily obtained .... Depositions for these witnesses may be taxable, in the discretion of the district court.").
As for the amount incurred for depositions transcripts, this Circuit has continuously held that "[w]here a party notices a deposition to be recorded by both stenographic and non-stenographic means, and no objection is raised at that time as to the method of recordation, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c), a court can award the cost of conducting the deposition in the manner noticed." Watson, 492 F. App'x at 997 (citing Morrison v. Reichhold Chems., Inc., 97 F.3d 460, 464-65 (11th Cir. 1996) (holding that costs for a video deposition are properly taxable under 28 U.S.C. § 1920)). While the cost of a deposition transcript is generally recoverable, multiple copies are generally not recoverable. Barrera v. Weiss & Woolrich S., 900 F. Supp. 2d 1328, 1335 (S.D. Fla. 2012). Furthermore, when expedited costs are incurred merely for the convenience of counsel, such costs are not [*9]  taxable. Davis v. Sailormen, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100051, 2007 WL 1752465, at *4 (M.D. Fla. June 15, 2007); Tampa Bay Water v. HDR Eng'g, Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157631, 2012 WL 5387830, at *19 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 2, 2012). Likewise, shipping costs are not taxable, nor are condensed transcripts, ASCII, electronic transcripts, rough drafts, shipping and handling, or digitizing and synchronizing video depositions. See Watson, 492 Fed. Appx. at 997; Cardinale v. S. Homes of Polk Cnty., Inc., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41449, 2008 WL 2199273, at *1 (M.D. Fla. May 27, 2008); Tampa Bay Water, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157631, 2012 WL 5387830, at *19; Awwad v. Largo Med. Ctr., Inc., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 168894, 2013 WL 6198856, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 27, 2013); Lehman Bros. Holdings, Inc. v. Hirota, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87629, 2010 WL 3043653, at *4 (M.D. Fla. July 30, 2010).
Defendant claims costs for the court reporter appearance charges and transcription of the depositions of Norman Meidling, Steve Smith, Michael Barnes, Samy Morkus, Tina Lombardi, Dr. Spuza-Milord, Otto Ferro, Matthew Payne, Tangelia Aiken, and Sharon Malusa. Defendant further claims transcription fees for two pretrial conferences held on July 7, 2014, and October 24, 2014.
In considering whether the depositions were used at or necessary for trial and/or used in support of or opposition to summary judgment, I have reviewed the record and find that the depositions taken were properly related to the issues presented in this case and were used at or in connection with summary judgment proceedings and/or in preparation for trial. With the exception of Otto Ferro, each of these deponent's testimony was used in connection with summary judgment proceedings or they testified at trial. The Court is unaware of Otto Ferro or the purpose of his deposition and thus cannot determine [*10]  that his deposition was necessarily obtained for use in the case.6 As a result, I find that reasonable costs associated with the depositions of Norman Meidling, Steve Smith, Michael Barnes, Samy Morkus, Tina Lombardi, Dr. Spuza-Milord, Matthew Payne, Tangelia Aiken, and Sharon Malusa are properly taxable.
As to the amount incurred for each deposition, upon review of the invoices certain invoices lack sufficient detail regarding the charges which are not otherwise explained. (See Doc. 172-1 at 5, 12). In addition, these invoices do not provide sufficient detail to determine the amounts charged and what services were provided. As such, the two invoices (found at Doc. 172-1 at 5, 12) relating to Norman Meidling and Dr. Spuza-Milord will be excluded.
With regard to the depositions of Mr. Meidling, it appears from the record that he was deposed on September 6, 2013, and December 20, 2013, resulting in four transcript volumes totaling 568 pages. (See Docs. 42, 43). Defendant seeks $3,638.05 and $4,270.90 for the costs associated with the two depositions, respectively. (See Doc. 172 at ¶ 4). The per page charges are not well indicated and it appears that Defendant is seeking costs for both an [*11]  original and a copy. I conclude that this District's benchmark of $3.65 per page is a reasonable maximum amount per page for these deposition transcripts.
The hourly appearance charges for the court reporters and videographers appear reasonable. In addition, the cost for exhibits to the depositions may be properly taxed,7 but the Court will exclude all ancillary costs such as shipping, condensed transcripts, multiple copies, expedite charges, and summary charges as costs for the convenience of counsel.
As such, deposition costs are properly taxed in the following corresponding amounts:

Taking into consideration the appropriate deductions, Walgreens' recovery for printed or electronically recorded transcripts is reduced to $6,127.20.
To the extent that Walgreens seeks reimbursement for transcripts of two pretrial conferences, the Court concludes such transcripts were necessarily obtained for use in this case. As such, this Court awards Walgreens $478.15 for the cost of hearing transcripts.
Next, Walgreens seeks [*12]  $110.00 in witness fees. The recovery of witness fees under § 1920(3) is limited by § 1821, which authorizes travel reimbursement and a $40.00 per diem. Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 126 S. Ct. 2455, 2460, 165 L. Ed. 2d 526 (2006). Witness fees and allowances are to be paid to "a witness in attendance at any court of the United States, or before a United States Magistrate Judge, or before any person authorized to take his deposition pursuant to any rule or order of a court of the United States." 28 U.S.C. § 1821(a).
It seeks $40.00 each for two witnesses — Dr. Milord-Spuza for appearance at deposition and Steve Smith for appearance at trial — and an additional $30.00 for mileage cost for Steve Smith. The Court awards Walgreens $110.00 for witness fees.
Lastly, Defendant seeks $3,333.49 for copies. In short, § 1920(4) provides that the cost of such matters necessarily obtained for use in the case can be taxed. In connection with the taxation of copying costs, the following offers useful guidance:
[T]he costs of photocopies are recoverable if the copies were necessarily obtained for use in the case. The party moving for taxation of costs must present evidence regarding the documents copied including their use or intended use. As the prevailing party alone knows the purpose of the copies, it cannot simply make [*13]  unsubstantiated claims that copies of the documents were necessary. Rather, the prevailing party must provide information regarding the purpose of copies charged so the court will be able to determine the purpose of the copies as well as whether the rates paid for copies were reasonable, and whether the copies made were related to the action at issue. In evaluating whether copies were necessary, the Court does not award costs for copies made merely for counsel's convenience, such as multiple copies of documents. Similarly, general copying costs without further description are not recoverable. The costs associated with copying documents for the purpose of providing them to the court, however, are reimbursable. Likewise, a prevailing party may recover costs of copies produced to opposing counsel. Thus, a party must demonstrate that copies were necessarily obtained for a reimbursable use in the case.
Monelus v. Tocodrian, Inc., 609 F. Supp. 2d 1328, 1335 (S.D. Fla. 2009) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); Desisto Coll., Inc. v. Town of Howey-in-the-Hills, 718 F. Supp. 906, 913 (M.D. Fla. 1989), overruled on other grounds, 213 F.3d 600 (11th Cir. 2000). Again, "[t]he burden of establishing entitlement to photocopying expenses lies with the prevailing party." Scelta v. Delicatessen Support Servs., Inc., 203 F. Supp. 2d 1328, 1340 (M.D. Fla. 2002) (citing Desisto Coll., Inc., 718 F. Supp. at 910 n.1); see also Scelta at 1340-41 ("[S]ince the defendants have not described the photocopying costs sufficiently to permit [*14]  a determination of which photocopies were necessarily obtained for use in this case, reimbursement for photocopying costs is rejected in its entirety."); Desisto Coll., Inc. at 914 (denying reimbursement for photocopying because the prevailing party failed to differentiate between copies necessarily obtained for use in the case and those for convenience).
Upon review, Defendant has not provided any invoices or explanation of the "copies" for "Plaintiff's deposition exhibits10," "discovery requests/responses to Plaintiff," and "third party subpoenas." (Doc. 172 at 4). The Court is unable to identify the necessity of these costs as there is no indication as to what documents were copied or for what purpose. See Cullens v. Ga. Dep't of Transp., 29 F.3d 1489, 1494 (11th Cir. 1994) (holding court did not err in disallowing photocopying costs where plaintiff failed to provide evidence regarding the documents including their use or intended use). Thus, the Court finds that Defendant has failed to meet its burden with respect to these claimed copy costs under § 1920(4). The remaining copy costs are well-documented, explained, and thus properly taxable in the amount of $3,054.49.
Accordingly, as set forth above, the Court GRANTS in part Defendant's construed motion for taxation of costs (Doc. 173) [*15]  and awards to Defendant $9,954.84 in total costs.

Plaintiff's Rule 54 and Rule 37(c) Motion for Attorney's Fees and Costs on the Unpaid Wages Claim
By his Rule 54 and Rule 37(c) Motion for Attorney's Fees and Costs on Unpaid Wage Claim (Doc. 177), Plaintiff seeks attorney's fees and costs incurred in litigating the claim for unpaid wages. In support, he files the declaration of his counsel, Kennan Dandar, claiming that Mr. Dandar spent 74.2 hours in actual time related to the unpaid wage claim at "reasonable hourly rate" of $450.00 for a total of $33,390.00 in fees.11 (Doc. 178-1 at ¶ 6). He also asserts that he should be entitled to a contingency fee multiplier of 1.5 to 2.0 (Id. at ¶ 8).
In addition, Plaintiff seeks costs related to Dr. Spuza-Milord's $1,500 charge for preparation and appearance and an unspecified amount for her "trial fee" and seeks to compensate his attorney fee expert James Tanner an unspecified amount for ten hours spent reviewing the file in connection with his affidavit attesting to the reasonableness of fees.12 (Doc. 177 at 11).
Plaintiff claims that he is entitled to attorney's fees pursuant to § 448.08, Fla. Stat., as well as Rule 37(c) "for Defendant's failure to admit that it did not pay Plaintiff the last two weeks of employment." [*16]  (Doc. 177 at 1). As Plaintiff asserts (and Defendant has conceded), despite terminating Mr. Meidling in January 2012, Walgreens sent his last two weeks paycheck in October 2013 - after the filing of the instant lawsuit and nearly twenty-two months after Mr. Meidling's termination. By Plaintiff's argument, Defendant chose not to pay Plaintiff for his last two weeks pay, unnecessarily denied that Plaintiff's claim was valid, and perpetuated hard-fought and contentious litigation on this issue, which resulted in unnecessary discovery and multiple motions aimed at denying Plaintiff's entitlement to attorney's fees. Plaintiff illustrates by outlining ten separate motions that Defendant filed directed at the unpaid wages claim. (Doc. 177 at 5-8).
In response, Defendant asserts that it "prevailed on every significant issue and claim in this case" (Doc. 189 at 1), and Plaintiff is not entitled to any fees and costs. Defendant points out that Plaintiff repeatedly (and erroneously) asserted that § 448.01, Fla. Stat., was the basis of his unpaid wages claim. At no time did Plaintiff indicate that reference to § 448.01 was in error, despite Defendant's multiple pleadings directed at this error, and Plaintiff even made such [*17]  error in the parties' joint pretrial statement (Doc. 85). As such, Defendant urges that Plaintiff did not prevail on the claim he pled. Further, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's conduct establishes that the paycheck issue was insignificant because he failed to include the claim in his prayer for relief, failed to include the claim in his Rule 26 initial disclosures, conducted very little discovery on the issue, and refused to provide basic information, such as a computation of damages, on this claim.
Next, Defendant argues that the unpaid wages claim is moot. According to Walgreens: "On October 18, 2013, after Defendant could not confirm that Plaintiff had received his final paycheck, Defendant provided Plaintiff with another paycheck that represented full payment for the hours worked during the final pay period. This payment rendered moot any claim Plaintiff had 'for the last weeks Plaintiff worked,' as Plaintiff was provided with the full relief he requested." (Doc. 189 at 10).13 Even if the Court does not agree the claim was mooted by its voluntary payment, Walgreens urges that the Court should exercise its discretion to deny fees and costs on the claim. Moreover, it argues that Plaintiff [*18]  is not entitled to fees under Rule 37(c) and that the fees requested are unreasonable and excessive.
To the extent that there is an issue concerning the timeliness of Plaintiff's motion for fees and costs, the Court finds the motion timely filed. Following trial, this Court directed Plaintiff to file a supplemental pleading on damages. Plaintiff thereafter made no claim of additional damages, but did file motions for fees and costs. These motions (Docs. 177, 179) were filed prior to entry of judgment in his favor.
Rule 54(d)(2)(B) states that "[u]nless otherwise provided by statute or order of the court, the motion must be filed no later than 14 days after entry of judgment." Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2)(B). Similarly, Local Rule 4.18 provides "all claims for costs or attorney's fees preserved by appropriate pleading or pretrial stipulation shall be asserted by separate motion or petition filed not later than fourteen (14) days following the entry of judgment." By their terms, the rules do not require that the motion be filed after judgment but only that the motion be on record two weeks following the entry of judgment. Thus, by this Court's consideration, the rules do not require that the motion be delayed until after judgment is entered. In a case such as this, [*19]  where the Court orally announced at trial judgment as a matter of law on one count for Plaintiff and directed the parties to file supplemental pleadings on damages, filing a motion for attorney's fees before the judgment has been entered is acceptable practice. See, e.g., Braun Builders, Inc. v. Kancherlapalli, No. 09-11534-BC, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81409, 2010 WL 3190867, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 11, 2010) ("where the jury has reached a verdict and the verdict has been filed on the docket, filing a motion for attorney fees before the judgment has been entered is an accepted practice"); Contract Materials Processing, Inc. v. Kataleuna GmbH Catalysts, 222 F. Supp. 2d 733, 739 (D. Md. 2002) ("It is clear ... from the plain language of the rule that the fourteen-day period marks an outer temporal limit for filing a motion for attorney's fees; it does not establish an unalterable 14 day post-final-judgment window only within which a motion for an award of attorney's fees may be filed.") (emphasis in original)14; but see Hendricks v. Rambosk, No. 2:10-cv-526-FTM29, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118485, 2011 WL 4903072, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 13, 2011) (denying motions for fees and costs as premature but without prejudice where the court specifically withheld the entry of judgment until the conclusion of the case); Founders Ins. Co. v. Cortes-Garcia, No. 8:10-cv-2286-T-EAK, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23365, 2013 WL 937820, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 11, 2013) (denying without prejudice motion for attorney's fees as premature where a count remained undecided).
In light of the above, the Court finds that [*20]  Plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees and costs was filed within the time prescribed by the rules and thus timely, even though filed prior to entry of the judgment in his favor.
As for the merits of the claim for fees, the Court notes initially that this matter should have presented a simple, straightforward claim for failure to pay Plaintiff for his last two weeks of work. Instead, obstinate counsel on both sides and sloppy development of the claim resulted in an overblown and overly complicated legal battle that far exceeded what should have been necessary. Plaintiff seeks fees through trial on a claim that could have and should have been resolved without the necessity of a suit. Despite its lengthy failure to pay the monies owed Plaintiff and its aggressive denial of any liability for fees necessitated by its conduct, Defendant argues that Plaintiff ran up unnecessary fees on a claim that was insignificant and ultimately moot as of October 18, 2013. Such ignores the fact that Walgreens failed to pay the monies owed for over twenty-two months and paid only after suit was filed against it. Plaintiff overstates the legal effort on this claim and fails to acknowledge his contribution [*21]  to the extended litigation, but Walgreens minimizes or ignores the lengths to which its counsel went to deny the allegations and to avoid paying attorney's fees despite the statutory provision allowing for the recovery of such fees in instances in which an employer fails to pay wages. Instead of acknowledging the two weeks pay due to Plaintiff, Defendant vehemently denied that it failed to pay Plaintiff his last week's paycheck and to this day asserts that Defendant prevailed on the claim because it voluntarily paid him after suit was filed. At trial, its representative admitted that a mistake was made and he offered no defense to the nonpayment. Thus, Walgreens' refusal to acknowledge the claim and pay it promptly along with its counsels' obstinate refusal to acknowledge its obligation to pay Plaintiff for work reasonably performed by his counsel prolonged the litigation and necessarily increased the time Plaintiff's counsel spent on this claim.
That said, Plaintiff's presentation of the claim was sloppy from the outset of his suit. Counsel incorrectly pleaded the claim as a statutory claim and repeatedly failed to provide Defendant and the Court with a clear picture of what he was [*22]  actually claiming and the resulting damages. Plaintiff improperly attempted to conflate a claim for "unpaid wages" under the common law with a claim for "overtime worked during his entire employment" and repeatedly failed to quantify the damages — despite warnings from three separate judges in this court. This made defense counsel's job more difficult and prompted Walgreens to file repeated motions directed at these deficiencies.
Nonetheless, § 448.08, Fla. Stat., provides that a court may award prevailing party costs and attorney's fees. As explained by Florida's Second District Court of Appeal, § 448.08 provides "a means to equalize the disparate positions of employees in attempting to collect for the fruits of their labors." Tampa Bay Publ'ns, Inc. v. Watkins, 549 So. 2d 745, 747 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1989). "[P]laintiffs in actions for unpaid wages often do not have the financial means to obtain counsel on an hourly basis. If plaintiff's counsel were only limited to a contingent recovery rather than a reasonable court-awarded fee under section 448.08, attorneys would be discouraged from assuming stewardship of cases to recover unpaid wages unless substantial amounts of money were involved. Therefore, section 448.08 acts as a method by which to equalize otherwise disparate financial abilities of employees to retain counsel." Id. [*23] ; see also Hingson v. MMI of Florida, Inc., 8 So. 3d 398, 401 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2009); Doyal v. Sch. Bd. of Liberty Cnty., 415 So. 2d 791, 793 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1982). Defendant's argument that Plaintiff is not entitled to fees because his claim was "moot" when Defendant sent a check representing "full" payment on October 18, 2013, and its reliance on Zinni and Dionne are misplaced. In Zinni, the Eleventh Circuit held that a settlement offer for the full amount of statutory damages requested under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ("FDCPA"), without an accompanying offer of judgment, did not offer "full relief" to plaintiff and therefore did not render the plaintiff's claim moot. 692 F.3d at 1167-68. And, Defendant neglects an important footnote in Dionne in which the Eleventh Circuit stated:
Our decision in this matter addresses a very narrow question: whether an employee who conceded that his claim should be dismissed before trial as moot, when the full amount of back pay was tendered, was a prevailing party entitled to statutory attorney's fees under § 216(b). It should not be construed as authorizing the denial of attorney's fees, requested by an employee, solely because an employer tendered the full amount of back pay owing to an employee, prior to the time a jury has returned its verdict, or the trial court has entered judgment on the merits of the [*24]  claim.
667 F.3d at 1206 n.6 (emphasis added); see also Wolff v. Royal Am. Mgmt., Inc., 545 Fed. Appx. 791 (11th Cir. 2013) (holding that former employee's acceptance of a settlement check did not render the FLSA claim moot, as would strip former employee of statutory right to recover fees and costs).15
There is relatively little authority regarding the issue of attorney's fees under § 448.08 and no authority that this Court can find specifically addressing entitlement to attorney's fees under this statute when a defendant voluntarily pays the wages after the initiation of suit. However, the above-cited cases are instructive.
Plaintiff in this case never conceded that his unpaid wages claim was moot, and in fact maintained throughout that he was not paid all of what he was owed. The parties did not enter into a settlement agreement of the claim, nor is there evidence of an offer of judgment. As determined at trial, Plaintiff was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this claim and, although Plaintiff was not awarded any additional damages, he was awarded judgment and the right to pursue fees and costs. The Court finds this claim of the type that the legislature intended to compensate [*26]  — where an employee is forced to initiate litigation in order to collect wages rightfully due. Walgreens cannot escape its obligation to make its former employee whole by providing him his last paycheck (twenty-two months after termination and after the filing of a lawsuit) but without fees and costs reasonably expended to obtain that relief.
That being said, the Court agrees that Plaintiff's claimed attorney's fees are excessive in these circumstances. The starting point in determining reasonable attorney's fees is the calculation of the lodestar, which is product of the hours reasonably expended multiplied by reasonable hourly rate(s). Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1983); Norman v. Hous. Auth. of Montgomery, 836 F.2d 1292 (11th Cir. 1988). "[A] reasonable hourly rate is the prevailing market rate in the relevant legal community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skills, experience, and reputation." Duckworth v. Whisenant, 97 F.3d 1393, 1396 (11th Cir. 1996) (quoting Norman, 836 F.2d at 1299). In determining the reasonableness of hours expended, it is appropriate for the court to exclude excessive, redundant, and unnecessary hours; hours which are inadequately documented; and hours which would be unreasonable for an attorney to bill the client or opposing counsel in the exercise of good billing judgment. The lodestar, as calculated under Hensley [*27] , presumptively includes consideration of the so-called Johnson factors. See Norman, 836 F.2d at 1299. In Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., the court set out twelve factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of fees: (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved; (3) the skill required to perform the legal services properly; (4) the preclusion of other employment due to acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) the time limitations imposed by the client or other circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the undesirability of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases. 488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974). In "determining a fee award [the court] must explain how his consideration of the Johnson factors affected the award." See In re Celotex Corp., 227 F.3d 1336, 1341 (11th Cir. 2000); NAACP v. City of Evergreen, Ala., 812 F.2d 1332, 1336 (11th Cir. 1987) (quoting King v. McCord, 621 F.2d 205, 206 (5th Cir. 1980)). Moreover, "[w]hen a district court finds the number of hours claimed is unreasonably high, the court has two choices: it may conduct an hour-by-hour analysis or it may reduce the requested hours with an across-the-board cut." Bivins v. Wrap It Up, Inc., 548 F.3d 1348, 1350 (11th Cir. 2008) [*28] .
Plaintiff employs the lodestar method in calculating his fees and seeks $33,390.00 in fees based on an hourly rate for counsel of $450.00 per hour for 74.2 hours of work.16 In support of this request, Plaintiff argues that he has been awarded his hourly fee of $450.00 for over twenty years, and such rate was agreed to be reasonable by his client in his contingency fee contract. (Doc. 178-1 at ¶ 3). He claims that what appeared to be a simple failure to timely pay wages was "greatly exasperated" by Walgreens' tactics. (Id. at ¶ 4).
After careful consideration of the factors, I conclude that reduction in both the hourly rate requested and the total hours expended is appropriate. On the matter of reasonable hourly rate, lead counsel Kennan Dandar is an experienced trial attorney with more than thirty years in practice. In this case, he undertook to represent Plaintiff on a contingency fee basis and initiated suit in 2012. As noted, the litigation was contentious and hard fought on both sides and the unpaid wages claim in particular garnered considerable motion practice. Nevertheless, the Court disagrees that this was a complex claim. On the contrary, from a legal standpoint, [*29]  this claim should have been straightforward and simple, but was unnecessarily complicated by Plaintiff's failure to articulate and quantify his claim and by Walgreens' refusal to admit to its mistake in not paying Mr. Meidling. Based on my experience, lead trial counsel who specialize in this area of the law are now typically billing at hourly rates ranging from $300.00 to $450.00 per hour. Such rates vary depending on counsel's experience, the complexity of the case, and whether the case is tried. By my consideration, in the circumstances of this case and given the quality of the work exhibited on this claim, Mr. Dandar is fairly and reasonably compensated at an hourly rate of $300.00 per hour.
As for the number of hours sought, while it appears correct that such were driven, at least in part, by the aggressive defense by Walgreens, I nonetheless find them unusually high for this simple claim. As discussed above, Plaintiff's sloppy pleading and presentation of this claim resulted in considerable motion practice by the defense. Much of Plaintiff's response to this could have been avoided had counsel better presented the claim and timely complied with Court orders and his discovery responsibilities. [*30]  Moreover, there is evidence of redundant and excessive hours not properly billed to a client in the exercise of good billing judgment.17 And, by any measure, Plaintiff was only partially and minimally successful in this suit. Stated otherwise, he was entirely unsuccessful on the balance of his claims and in particular the ADA claims that proceeded to trial. The facts, circumstances, and legal arguments on the ADA claims were largely distinct from the unpaid wages claim and he cannot claim any compensation for that work. In sum, after full consideration, I conclude that a downward adjustment by forty percent for the 55.8 hours sought by Mr. Dandar is necessary and appropriate.
As noted above, in addition to the 55.8 hours claimed for work on this claim, counsel asserts that he spent an additional 18.4 hours in connection with this fee request. Based on the Court's experience with handling such matters, this claim is simply excessive. Under no circumstances would such sum be billed a client in the exercise of good billing judgment, nor should it be billed Defendant in the circumstances. Because these hours also reflect excessive and unnecessary work, the Court hereby reduces the hours claimed [*31]  by 60 percent to 6.6 hours.
Accordingly, as set forth above, the Court GRANTS in part Plaintiff's Rule 54 and Rule 37(c) Motion for Attorney's Fees and Costs on Unpaid Wage Claim (Doc. 177) awards to Plaintiff $12,648.00 in attorney's fees for the unpaid wages claim.18
Plaintiff's requests for a contingency fee multiplier and for costs associated with Dr. Spuza-Milord and fee expert James Tanner are denied on this motion.

Plaintiff's Motion for Taxation of Costs
By his next motion, Plaintiff seeks to tax costs against Defendant "as prevailing party." (Doc. 179). In support, he has filed a Bill of Costs (Doc. 179-1) and a statement of costs (Doc. 179-2). Defendant opposes the motion on various grounds, arguing that Plaintiff is not the prevailing party, the motion is procedurally deficient, and he seeks costs which are not taxable under 28 U.S.C. § 1920. (Doc. 190).
The Court agrees with Defendant that the motion is deficient. Accepting that Plaintiff is the prevailing party on the unpaid wages claim and thus entitled to costs, Plaintiff fails to support his motion with any memorandum of law or documentary support. Although the motion indicates that "[i]ndividuals bills will be filed separately" (Doc. 179), no such bills have been filed [*32]  or provided to the Court. Moreover, the Bill of Costs (Doc. 179-1) is unsigned by Plaintiff's counsel and the amounts listed on the Bill of Costs differ from those provided on the statement of costs (Doc. 179-2). This Court is unable to determine the necessity, reasonableness, or purpose of these costs, and is left to guess even as to the total amount that Plaintiff seeks.
Accordingly, upon consideration, Plaintiff's Motion for Taxation of Costs (Doc. 179) is DENIED.

Plaintiff's Renewed Motion for Taxation of Costs, Plaintiff's Renewed Rule 54 and Rule 37(c) Motion Attorney's Fees and Costs on Unpaid Wages, and Defendant's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Renewed Motions for Fees and Costs
By its motion to strike (Doc. 202), Defendant seeks to strike Plaintiff's renewed motions for fees and costs (Docs. 196, 197) as untimely and improperly filed. It urges that the pleadings were filed contrary to Local Rule 3.01(c) and were filed more than fourteen days after the entry of judgment in violation of Local Rule 4.18 and Federal Rule 54(d). Defendant attaches an email exchange between counsel wherein Plaintiff's counsel states, "I will file a withdrawal of the renewed motions...." (Doc. 202-1). No such notice of withdrawal has been filed with the Court, [*33]  nor has Plaintiff filed a response to the motion to strike.
Judgment in favor of Plaintiff on Count VII was entered on April 15, 2015 (Doc. 194), and on April 20, 2015, the Court denied Plaintiff's motion to alter to amend the judgment as moot (Doc. 195). On May 8, 2015, Plaintiff filed his renewed motions for attorney's fees and costs. (Docs. 196, 197). The motions are nearly identical to those filed prior to entry of judgment (Docs. 177, 179) discussed above, and contain no substantive changes. Plaintiff's motions (Docs. 196, 197) were filed more than fourteen days after entry of judgment and more than fourteen days after this Court denied his motion to alter or amend judgment. As such, the Court agrees that Plaintiff's motions are untimely. See M.D. Fla. R. 4.18(a); Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d).
Moreover, based on the submission from Defendant's counsel, Plaintiff agreed via email to withdraw the motions. Although counsel did not file a notice with the Court that he withdraws the motions, he failed to respond to the motion to strike. Thus, the motion to strike is deemed unopposed. See M.D. Fla. R. 3.01(b).
Accordingly, Defendant's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Renewed Motions for Fees and Costs (Doc. 202) is  [*34] GRANTED in part. The Clerk is directed to strike Plaintiff's renewed motions for fees and costs (Docs. 196, 197). Defendant's request for fees and costs associated with this motion is denied.
DONE AND ORDERED in Tampa, Florida, this 19th day of June 2015.
