CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

PROCEEDINGS (in chambers):ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [Docket No. 20]
This matter is before the Court on Defendant BNSF Railway Company's ("BNSF" or "Defendant") Motion for Summary Judgment ("Motion"), filed May 15, 2015. Plaintiff Antonio Alamillo ("Plaintiff") filed his Opposition on May 29, 2015. Defendant filed its Reply on June 8, 2015.1 The Court found this matter suitable for disposition without oral argument and vacated the hearing set for June 22, 2015. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b). For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion.
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
A. Undisputed Facts
In this action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy, Plaintiff [*2]  alleges that he was terminated because he missed calls due to sleep apnea and that Defendant did not reasonably accommodate his disability. (Notice of Removal ("Notice") Ex. A ("Compl.") ¶ 17, ECF No. 1.) The following facts are undisputed.
1. Plaintiff's Employment with BNSF
In 2012, Plaintiff Antonio Alamillo ("Plaintiff') was employed as a locomotive engineer by Defendant. (Pl.'s Statement of Uncontroverted Facts ("SUF") ¶ 1, ECF No. 20-1.) BNSF Railway is an international freight railroad operating over approximately 32,000 track miles in 28 states and three Canadian provinces. (SUF ¶ 2.) It presently employs approximately 46,000 employees, the majority of whom primarily work as locomotive engineers and conductors represented by one of two rail unions, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers ("BLET") and the United Transportation Union (now known as "SMARTTD"). (SUF ¶ 2.) There are two principal kinds of jobs that engineers such as Plaintiff could be assigned to: (1) a five day a week job in one of the railroad's rail yards, which involves set hours; and, (2) assignment to an the "extra board," in which they must be "on call" at all times to fill assignments between terminals that [*3]  become available due to spikes in freight volume or the unavailability of other employees. (SUF ¶ 3.) The engineers bid on the yard and extra board positions based on their seniority. (SUF ¶ 4.) Plaintiff had engineer seniority since he became an engineer in 1999, and could bid on a job with an 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. work schedule five days a week at the same location if he chose to. (SUF ¶ 4.)
Between January and June 2012, Plaintiff instead chose to work on the "extra board" based in Wilmington, California, in which he primarily filled in for trainmen who were out sick or on vacation leave. He never knew when he was going to be called, and had to be available if he was called every day. (SUF ¶ 5.) As of May and June 2012, Plaintiff had a variable work schedule and had to go to work on three hours' notice. (SUF ¶ 6.)
By choosing to bid on and accepting an "extra board" assignment, Plaintiff agreed to be available by phone 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, and to report for duty when called. (SUF ¶ 7.) Promptly responding to calls and reporting for duty are essential for extra board employees so that the railroad is able to meet customer demands and expectations and avoid delays. (SUF [*4]  ¶ 8.) Unanticipated employee absences due to missed calls for work create problems for other employees by requiring them to work additional and unexpected hours to fill in for absent colleagues. Such absences can also cause logistical snarls, such as train delays and service disruptions that can ripple throughout the railroad nationwide. (SUF ¶ 9.)
2. BNSF's Operating Rules
Missing a call to work is a violation of written work rules; GCOR Rules 1.15 and 1.16, entitled "Duty Reporting or Absence" and "Subject to Call," respectively, provide that "Employees must report for duty at the designated time and place with the necessary equipment to perform their duties," and that "Employees subject to call must indicate where they can be reached and must not be absent from their calling place without notifying those requested to call them." (SUF ¶ 10.) Part I.A of the Policy for Employee Performance Accountability (the "PEPA Policy") states that a fifth "Standard Rule Violation" within a twelve-month review period may result in dismissal. (SUF ¶ 13.) As a locomotive engineer, it was Plaintiff's responsibility to know and comply with these rules on a daily basis. (SUF ¶ 14.) As of 2012, Plaintiff understood [*5]  that a missed call constituted a rule violation, and that five rule violations in 12 months could result in termination. (SUF ¶ 15.)
Locomotive engineers are called to work by means of automated phone calls made by the BNSF crew office to the phone number or numbers that the employees have on file with the railroad. (SUF ¶ 16.) The calls inform the employee of a time to report (usually not more than three hours), a description of the train he or she will be assigned to, and the location to which they are to report. (SUF ¶ 16.) If there are three unanswered calls within a fifteen minute period, the employee is considered to have missed a call and to have "laid off" work that day. (SUF ¶ 17.)
3. Plaintiff's Missed Calls
Plaintiff missed seven calls between January 28 and April 23, 2012, as well as a call in August 2011. (SUF ¶ 18.) At various times during 2011 through 2012, Los Angeles Terminal Superintendent Richard Dennison met with Plaintiff and his supervisor, Superintendent of Operations Keith Miller to discuss Plaintiff's continued missed calls. (SUF ¶ 19.) These discussions were an effort to stave off the discipline that Plaintiff would otherwise receive for his rule violations and [*6]  to impress upon him the importance of improving his availability for work when he was called to service. (SUF ¶ 19.) Dennison met with Plaintiff on or around April 23, 2012, after Plaintiff had missed seven calls during the first four months of the year. (SUF ¶ 21.) Plaintiff sought out Dennison to meet with him on that occasion, and they had a short meeting in an office at the Watson Yard terminal during which he apologized to Dennison for the missed calls. (SUF ¶ 22.) Plaintiff received "Alternative Handling" for the calls he missed on January 28, 29, and 31, 2012 at his request. By opting for the training provided in Alternative Handling Plan, Plaintiff understood he would not be disciplined and would have to go through training to improve his performance with respect to these violations. (SUF ¶ 23.) In the meeting, Plaintiff did not say anything about any medical condition causing him to miss any calls. Previously, Plaintiff said that he had gotten a message after his phone never rang, but he did not do anything to address the problem. (SUF ¶ 25.) Dennison told Plaintiff he needed to do something to rectify the problem of missing calls, and suggested that he get a land line as [*7]  an alternative or back-up to his cell phone. (SUF ¶ 26.) Plaintiff's cell phone number was the only number he had given the Railroad to contact him. (SUF ¶ 27.)
Plaintiff responded by stating that he "can't get a land line because mama will know I don't go to Barstow anymore," which Dennison understood referred to the fact that Plaintiff had a relationship with a female employee of the railroad. (SUF ¶ 28.) At the time of his discussion with Dennison, Plaintiff was in fact having an affair and did not want anyone calling a landline at home instead of his cell phone, because there were occasions when Plaintiff left the house to see his girlfriend when his wife thought he was at work. (SUF ¶ 29.) Plaintiff told Dennison that he was living in the hills and that the phone reception was bad. (SUF ¶ 30.) Plaintiff found out that he missed the calls in March and April 2012 when he logged onto the BNSF website after the fact. (SUF ¶ 31.) Plaintiff normally worked five days a week when he was assigned to the extra board, and was able to hear his phone when he was called on most days. (SUF ¶ 32.)
In Plaintiff's meeting with Dennison, Dennison went through the missed calls and told Plaintiff that [*8]  he was going to count three missed calls as one so that Plaintiff would be disciplined for only one missed call. As a result, Plaintiff received 10 day and 20 day record suspensions for his missed calls on March 18 and 20, 2012, and his missed calls of March 16 and April 23 were cancelled. (SUF ¶ 34.) Plaintiff understood after his meeting with Dennison that he could be dismissed if he missed another call. (SUF ¶ 35.)
However, Plaintiff thereafter proceeded to miss three more calls within the next two months. (SUF ¶ 36.) After the next missed call, Plaintiff told Dennison that he had let him down and "screwed up." (SUF ¶ 37.) Plaintiff contacted Dennison after he missed the call at 5:34a.m. on May 13, 2012, and asked if it could be excused due to the fact that it did not register on his phone. (SUF ¶ 38.) Dennison told Plaintiff that they were proceeding with the investigation because it was his responsibility to have a phone in working order. (SUF ¶ 39.)
On May 21, 2012, Plaintiff missed a call at 5:15a.m. (SUF ¶ 40.) Plaintiff understood when he missed the May 21 call that dismissal was the next proper step in the employee discipline process, and that any discipline he received would [*9]  be imposed after he was able to attend an investigation hearing with his union representative. (SUF ¶ 41.) Plaintiff missed the call on June 16, 2012, at 5:15 a.m., purportedly because he did not hear the phone. (SUF ¶ 42.) When Plaintiff started missing the calls in March and April 2012, it did not occur to him to look into getting a regular five-day-a-week job instead of being on the extra boar because he did not think he had a medical problem. (SUF ¶ 43.) Plaintiff thought he was not receiving calls because of a weak signal issue on his phone, due to the fact that he had received a lot of dropped calls. (SUF ¶ 43.)
At the time of his missed calls in 2012, Plaintiff was living in Chino Hills with his wife and 23-year-old son. (SUF ¶ 44.) After he began missing calls in 2012, Plaintiff did not ask his wife to wake him up if his phone rang and he was still asleep. (SUF ¶ 46.) In 2010, while he was also on the extra board, Plaintiff set his alarm clock for 5:00 a.m. after he checked his computer and learned that he could be called for a job commencing at 7:59 a.m. (SUF ¶ 47.) Even though the most common time Plaintiff was called to work in 2012 was 5:00 a.m., he did not set his alarm to [*10]  wake him at that time and did not check the electronic job board to see what jobs he could be called for the next day, as he had in prior years when he was also assigned to the "extra board." (SUF ¶ 48.)
4. Plaintiff's Sleep Study
Sometime after the June 16, 2012, missed call, Plaintiff began to suspect that he had a condition that affected his ability to hear the phone, and discussed sleep issues with a doctor. (SUF ¶ 49.) Plaintiff did not know that he had any kind of sleep disorder before his last missed call, and did not tell anyone at BNSF that he was going to undergo a sleep study before that time. (SUF ¶ 50.) Plaintiff first believed that his inability to hear the phone while asleep may have been caused by his sleep apnea after his sleep study that was conducted on July 29, 2012. (SUF ¶ 51.) Although Division General Manager Mark Kirschinger agreed to meet with Plaintiff and his representative, Plaintiff missed another call before the meeting was actually held. (SUF ¶ 52.)
Plaintiff first mentioned that he thought he might have some medical condition during his meeting with Kirschinger, and Kirschinger said he could present whatever information he wanted to in the investigation. [*11]  (SUF ¶ 53.) When Plaintiff told Kirschinger about the intended sleep study, Kirschinger told him to bring results to the sleep center tests when they were completed, but that the investigation into the missed calls was going to proceed and he was still subject to discipline for the missed calls. (SUF ¶ 54.) Kirschinger did not tell Plaintiff that the results of the sleep test would affect the discipline Plaintiff would receive. (SUF ¶ 55.) In the meeting, Plaintiff asked Kirschinger to be put on a regular schedule, and Kirschinger told him to go ahead and follow the usual union procedures to make the bump and bid on a regular five-day a week work schedule with set hours. (SUF ¶ 56.) Plaintiff was thereafter able to obtain a job with a regular schedule with set hours, and was able to wake up to his alarm clock at the same time and to come to work on time every day after receiving that position. (SUF ¶ 57.) Plaintiff did not request a schedule change earlier because he "did not think he had a problem." (SUF ¶ 58.) Plaintiff did not access the Frequently Asked Questions page on the BNSF website regarding reasonable accommodations for disability, and never tried to access the Employee [*12]  Request for Accommodation form that was available on that site to employees and applicants. (SUF ¶ 60.)
5. Investigations
When an investigation is held for charges of violations of BNSF's rules, the hearing is transcribed and, if the case involves a potential employee dismissal, the transcript of the proceedings is sent to BNSF' s Labor Relations Department in Fort Worth, Texas for review under the Company's PEPA Policy. (SUF ¶ 63.) Rail employees such as locomotive engineers may only be disciplined after they are provided the opportunity to answer any charges of alleged misconduct or rule violations at a formal "investigation" hearing. (SUF ¶ 64.) Investigations are governed by various collective bargaining agreements entered into by the Railway and the rail unions which represent the employees. (SUF ¶ 65.) The purpose of investigations is to ascertain facts and determine responsibility for alleged violations of the work rules and conduct policies. (SUF ¶ 66.) The investigations into the rule violations were initially scheduled to take place on June 14, 2012, but were postponed to August 22, 2012, at Plaintiff's request. (SUF ¶ 67.) Plaintiff remained an employee of the Railway as of [*13]  the time of the investigation, pending his dismissal. (SUF ¶ 68.)
Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between BNSF and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers ("BLET"), the union which represented Plaintiff, separate investigations were held on August 22, 2012, for each of the three alleged violations. (SUF ¶ 69.) Dennison attended the three investigations into Plaintiff's missed calls on August 22, 2012. The investigations were held in the Superintendent's Conference Room at the Railway's Hobart Terminal in Los Angeles. (SUF ¶ 70.)
In the initial investigation into the June 16, 2012 missed call, Plaintiff admitted that he missed the call on that date because he did not hear the phone, that he violated GCOR Rules 1.15 and 1.16 by missing the call that day, and that when he first noticed the missed call approximately three hours after it was made, he did not try to call his supervisor to let him know. (SUF ¶ 73.) In the investigation, Dennison also recounted his discussion with Plaintiff in April 2012, including his advice to Alamillo to either get a land line or a pager to ensure that he would not miss any more calls. (SUF ¶ 74.) The investigation into the May 21, 2012, missed call was [*14]  held immediately after the conclusion of the first investigation. (SUF ¶ 75.) A third investigation was held on August 22, 2012. (SUF ¶ 82.)
6. Dismissal
Following the completion of the investigations and delivery of the investigation transcripts, Dennison forwarded them to the PEPA Team for their review. (SUF ¶ 83.) In September 2012, BNSF Director of Labor Relations Andrea Smith consulted on the appropriate level of discipline under the PEPA Policy, if any, to assess, following the three investigation hearings. (SUF ¶ 84.) On September 10, 2012, Smith received an email from Dennison with the three formal investigation transcripts attached. (SUF ¶ 85.) After receiving the email, Smith reviewed the investigation transcripts and exhibits. Smith also reviewed Plaintiff's employee transcript. (SUF ¶ 86.)
Smith then prepared an email response dated September 18, 2012, in which she determined that Plaintiff should be given a 30-day record suspension for his missed call of May 13, 2012, and should be dismissed for his missed call of May 21, 2012 because this was his fifth violation in twelve months. (SUF ¶ 87.) In regard to whether leniency would be appropriate, Smith noted that Plaintiff has [*15]  a history of missing calls for service and was previously dismissed and reinstated on a leniency basis. (SUF ¶ 87.) Smith further recommended that Plaintiff also be dismissed for his missed call of June 16, 2012, which was his sixth rule violation in a twelve-month period. (SUF ¶ 88.) In making her recommendation for dismissal, Smith did not consider or rely on any information outside of Plaintiff's past discipline history and the evidence contained in the transcripts and exhibits from the three formal investigation hearings. (SUF ¶ 89.) Smith subsequently informed Dennison that the PEPA Team recommended dismissal of Plaintiff based on his violation of the rules that was established during the investigation. Shortly after she did so, Division General Manager Mark Kirschinger approved the dismissal. (SUF ¶ 91.)
As General Manager of the Division, Kirschinger's duties primarily consist of managing the personnel and overseeing the Company's rail operations for the entire state of California. He reports to Regional Vice President South Rob Reilly, who is based in Fort Worth, Texas. (SUF ¶ 92.) Kirschinger is the BNSF officer who is responsible for making the ultimate decision to terminate [*16]  any train-service employee who works for BNSF in California. (SUF ¶ 93.) The decision to dismiss Plaintiff was based solely on the evidence presented in the investigation into whether Plaintiff missed the calls for which he was charged, on the PEPA Team's recommendation, and on Plaintiff's repeated rule violations following the leniency that had been given to him by Dennison. (SUF ¶ 94.)
Plaintiff was informed on September 18, 2012 that he was being dismissed pursuant to General Code of Operating Rules 1.15 to 1.16 for the missed calls of May 21 and June 16, 2012. (SUF ¶ 96.) Following his dismissal, Plaintiff's union appealed his dismissal using the procedures under the applicable collective bargaining agreement. (SUF ¶ 98.) No one at BNSF led Plaintiff to believe that the rules violations would be excused because of the results of the sleep study. (SUF ¶ 100.) He was subsequently reinstated to service by an arbitrator after his union's appeal of the dismissal. (SUF ¶ 98.) Accordingly, he remains a BNSF employee to this day. (SUF ¶ 98.)
B. Procedural History
This action was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, on September 17, 2014. On November 12, 2014, Defendant removed [*17]  the action to this Court. On May 15, 2015, Defendant filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment.
II. DISCUSSION
A. Standard for Summary Judgment
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a) mandates that "the court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "When the party moving for summary judgment would bear the burden of proof at trial, it must come forward with evidence which would entitle it to a directed verdict if the evidence went uncontroverted at trial. In such a case, the moving party has the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of fact on each issue material to its case." C.A.R. Transp. Brokerage Co. v. Darden Rests., Inc., 213 F.3d 474, 480 (9th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted). In contrast, when the nonmoving party bears the burden of proving the claim or defense, the moving party does not need to produce any evidence or prove the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. Rather, the moving party's initial burden "may be discharged by 'showing'—that is, pointing out to the district court—that there is an absence of evidence to support [*18]  the nonmoving party's case." id.
Once the moving party meets its initial burden, the "party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the [nonmoving party]'s position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [nonmoving party]." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); accord Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) ("[O]pponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts."). Further, "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit . . . will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment [and] [f]actual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. At the summary judgment stage, a court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence. See id. at 249. A court is required to draw all inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587.
B. Standard for Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
To prevail on a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy, Plaintiff must show that the public policy has a basis in a constitutional, statutory, or regulatory provision. Green v. Ralee Eng'g Co., 19 Cal. 4th 66, 90, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046 (1998). Plaintiff argues that his [*19]  termination violated the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"). (Opp'n 6-7.) A prima facie case for physical disability discrimination requires a plaintiff to demonstrate: "(1) he suffers from a disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified to do his job; and (3) he was subjected to adverse employment action because of his disability." Faust v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729, 745 (Ct. App. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).
FEHA also makes it unlawful for an employer to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee with a known physical disability. Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(n). The responsibility to initiate the interactive process of fashioning an appropriate accommodation lies primarily with the employee. Spitzer v. Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 1384, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (Cal. Ct. App. 2000). The duty of an employer to reasonably accommodate an employee's handicap does not arise until the employer is aware of the employee's disability and physical limitations. Prilliman v. United Air Lines, Inc., 53 Cal. App. 4th 935, 949-50, 62 Cal. Rptr. 2d 142 (Cal. Ct. App. 1997) (citations omitted). The employee bears the burden of giving the employer notice of the disability. id. This notice then triggers the employer's burden to take "positive steps" to accommodate the employee's limitations. [*20]  id. The employee "retains a duty to cooperate with the employer's efforts by explaining her disability and qualifications." id. Reasonable accommodation thus envisions an exchange between employer and employee where each seeks and shares information to achieve the best match between the employee's capabilities and available position. id.
California has adopted the three-stage burden-shifting test established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), for workplace discrimination and retaliation claims. Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123, 1130 (Cal. 2005) (using the three-step burden-shifting analysis for retaliation claims); Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089, 1113 (Cal. 2000) (using the three-step burden-shifting analysis for age discrimination); Faust v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729, 745 (Ct. App. 2007) (using the three-step burden-shifting analysis for disability discrimination).
Under the burden-shifting framework, the plaintiff carries the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation. See Guz, 8 P.3d at 1113. The plaintiff must demonstrate that the employer's actions more likely than not have a basis of discriminatory animus. Ibarbia v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 191 Cal. App. 3d 1318, 237 Cal. Rptr. 92, 97 (Ct. App. 1987). If a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case creating a presumption of discrimination or retaliation, the burden shifts to the defendant to rebut the presumption by producing evidence that the plaintiff was reprimanded or terminated [*21]  for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). "If the employer sustains this burden, the plaintiff must then demonstrate that the proffered nondiscriminatory reason is merely a pretext for discrimination." Barefield v. Bd. of Trs. of Cal. State Univ., Bakersfield, 500 F. Supp. 2d 1244, 1259 (E.D. Cal. 2007). The ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue of actual discrimination and retaliation remains with the plaintiff. See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 153, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) ("The ultimate question in every employment discrimination case involving a claim of disparate treatment is whether the plaintiff was the victim of intentional discrimination.").
C. Analysis
Defendant argues that Plaintiff was terminated for repeated rule violations which took place before any reasonable accommodation was requested and that Defendant did not discriminate against Plaintiff because of his sleep apnea. Plaintiff responds that his sleep apnea is a disability, that he could perform his job with reasonable accommodations, that he was terminated because of his disability, and that Defendant had a duty to reasonably accommodate but refused to do so.
"'Reasonable accommodation' does not include excusing a failure to control a controllable disability or giving an employee a 'second chance' to control the disability in the future." Brundage v. Hahn, 57 Cal. App. 4th 228, 239, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 830 (1997) (citing Siefken v. Village of Arlington Heights, 65 F.3d 664, 666-67 (7th Cir. 1995)). Defendant [*22]  cites numerous cases in support of this theory. (See Mem. P. & A. 12-16.) In response, Plaintiff argues that in all of these cases the employees knew of their conditions but failed to control them, whereas here, Plaintiff did not know he suffered from obstructive sleep apnea at the time of the missed calls. (Opp'n 13-15.)
Plaintiff, however, cites no authority to support the proposition that rule violations caused by an undiagnosed disability are not cause for termination solely by virtue of the fact that the disability has not yet been diagnosed. "[A]n employer's duty to reasonably accommodate a disability is always prospective, and an employer is not required to excuse past misconduct." Trammell v. Raytheon Missile Sys., 721 F. Supp. 2d 876, 879 (D. Ariz. 2010) (citing EEOC Enforcement Guidance on the ADA at 31-32). Once termination is imminent according to the employer's policy, a request for accommodation is too late. id. It does not matter whether the employee was aware of the disability.
Plaintiff argues that he was entitled to the reasonable accommodation of "managerial leniency." (Opp'n 17.) But Brundage is clear that "'reasonable accommodation' does not include . . . giving an employee a 'second chance[.]'" 57 Cal. App. 4th at 239. Plaintiff may have been entitled to other reasonable accommodations, but in July and August [*23]  2012 when he requested them, it was too little, too late.
Here, the undisputed facts show that Plaintiff was terminated for rule violations that took place before any reasonable accommodations were requested. Plaintiff did not request a schedule change until at least July 29, 2012. (SUF ¶¶ 51, 58.) Plaintiff did not access the Frequently Asked Questions page on the BNSF website regarding reasonable accommodations for disability, and never tried to access the Employee Request for Accommodation form that was available on that site to employees and applicants. (SUF ¶ 60.) Plaintiff missed seven calls between January 28 and April 23, 2012, as well as a call in August 2011. (SUF ¶ 18.) Plaintiff understood that according to BNSF's rules, a missed call constituted a rule violation, and that five rule violations in 12 months could result in termination. (SUF ¶ 15.) The record of Plaintiff's termination hearings is clear. (See SUF ¶¶ 83-98.) BNSF Director of Labor Relations Andrea Smith determined that Plaintiff should be given a 30-day record suspension for his missed call of May 13, 2012, and should be dismissed for his missed call of May 21, 2012 because this was his fifth violation in twelve [*24]  months, noting that leniency was inappropriate because Plaintiff had a history of missing calls for service and was previously dismissed and reinstated on a leniency basis. (SUF ¶ 87.) Plaintiff was informed on September 18, 2012 that he was being dismissed pursuant to General Code of Operating Rules 1.15 to 1.16 for the missed calls of May 21 and June 16, 2012. (SUF ¶ 96.)
The undisputed facts show that Plaintiff's termination was for conduct in violation of Defendant's rules. The rules appear to have been job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity, since promptly responding to calls and reporting for duty are essential for extra board employees so that the railroad is able to meet customer demands and expectations and avoid delays. (See SUF ¶ 8.) Because Plaintiff's rule violations took place before any reasonable accommodation was requested, the Court finds as a matter of law based on facts that are not in material dispute that Defendant's termination of Plaintiff was not a wrongful termination in violation of public policy under California law. Accordingly, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.
III. RULING
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS [*25]  Defendant's Motion. This matter shall close.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
