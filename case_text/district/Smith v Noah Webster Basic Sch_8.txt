Opinion



ORDER
Pending before the Court is Defendant Noah Webster Basic School's Motion for Summary Judgment ("Def.'s Mot.") (Doc. 33).

I. Background
Plaintiff Rhonda Smith has a visual impairment, stemming from damage to her optic nerve approximately 15 years ago, which left her with monocular vision, limited peripheral vision, and the ability to see only lights and shadows with her right eye. (Pl.'s Separate Statement of Facts in Supp. of her Resp. to Def.'s Mot. ("PSOF") ¶¶ 6-7.) Plaintiff was employed as a kindergarten teacher on a one-year contract at Defendant Noah Webster Basic School ("the school"), a charter school in Mesa, Arizona, for the 2006-07 school year. (Def.'s Separate Statement of Facts in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. ("DSOF") ¶¶ 1-2.) Plaintiff was hired on July 8, 2006 by the school's director, Kelly Wade. [*2]  (DSOF ¶ 1, Ex. A 67:4-12.)
Before Plaintiff signed her employment contract, she reviewed the school's job description for the position of kindergarten teacher. (DSOF ¶ 6, Ex. A 67:16-21, Ex. C.) The job description states, "Specific vision abilities required by this job include close vision, distance vision, color vision, peripheral vision, depth perception, and ability to adjust focus." (DSOF, Ex. C.) The job description also states twice, "Reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions." (DSOF, Ex. C.) Plaintiff told Ms. Wade that she had a visual impairment before she signed the employment contract and stated that her disability would not hinder her ability to perform the job. (DSOF ¶ 4, Ex. A 69:2-70:3; PSOF ¶ 11.) On October 9, 2006, Plaintiff provided Defendant with a list of accommodations to help her in the classroom, all but one of which were provided by the school. (DSOF ¶¶ 54-59, 64-66, Ex. O; PSOF ¶¶ 45-47.)
Plaintiff's teaching performance was assessed through classroom observations and formal evaluations. (Def.'s Mot. at 10; DSOF ¶¶ 9-48, Exs. E-H, J-K.) Bill Taylor, the school's Assistant Principal, conducted [*3]  several of the observations. (DSOF ¶ 9, Ex. A 14:9-11, Exs. E-H.) His notes discuss a number of issues with Plaintiff's teaching and classroom management abilities, including lack of lesson planning or preparation, inadequate supervision of her students, excessive "dead time" in the classroom, and students blurting out answers rather than raising their hands. (DSOF ¶¶ 14-16, 22, 25, 26-27, 29-31; Exs. E-H.) In her formal evaluations, Plaintiff also lost points for her teaching style and classroom management, and her scores in the evaluations declined from the fall semester 2006 to the spring semester 2007. (DSOF, Exs. J-K.) According to Defendant, Plaintiff had the lowest performance scores of any kindergarten teacher at the school. (DSOF ¶ 42-44, Exs. J-L.) At the beginning of May 2007, Ms. Wade informed Plaintiff that her employment contract would not be renewed. (PSOF ¶ 111; DSOF ¶ 100, Ex. A 148:7-149:7.) Plaintiff alleges that when she asked why her contract was not going to be renewed, Ms. Wade said that it was because she "did not fit in." (PSOF ¶¶ 113-14; DSOF ¶ 104.)
Plaintiff subsequently filed this lawsuit. She alleges three incidents of discrimination: (1) when she was told [*4]  that she could not attend a group computer training class because of her vision and instead received one-on-one training; (2) when another teacher told her that she could not conduct pre-assessment testing on a Saturday because the print was too small; and (3) when her contract was not renewed. (DSOF ¶¶ 93-100.) Defendant has moved for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims.

II. Legal Standards and Analysis

A. Summary Judgment
The standard for summary judgment is set forth in Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Under Rule 56, summary judgment is properly granted when: (1) no genuine issues of material fact remain; and (2) after viewing the evidence most favorably to the non-moving party, the movant is clearly entitled to prevail as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Eisenberg v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 815 F.2d 1285, 1288-89 (9th Cir. 1987). A fact is "material" when, under the governing substantive law, it could affect the outcome of the case. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A "genuine issue" of material fact arises if "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id.
In considering a motion for summary judgment, the court must regard as true the non-moving party's evidence, if it is supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324; Eisenberg, 815 F.2d at 1289. However, the non-moving party may not merely rest [*5]  on its pleadings; it must produce some significant probative evidence tending to contradict the moving party's allegations, thereby creating a material question of fact. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256-57 (holding that the plaintiff must present affirmative evidence in order to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment); First Nat'l Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Serv. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 289, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1968).

B. Americans with Disabilities Act
The Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") prohibits discrimination "against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Discrimination includes "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless [an employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the [employer's] business[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). A "qualified individual with a disability" is "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the [*6]  employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). The ADA provides that "consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job." Id.
Where no direct evidence of discrimination is present, courts apply the burden-shifting analysis set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Mustafa v. Clark County Sch. Dist., 157 F.3d 1169, 1175-76 (9th Cir. 1998) (applying the McDonnell Douglas disparate impact analysis to a case involving disability discrimination). First, the Plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. "The burden then must shift to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection." Id. At this stage, the employer only has a burden of production, not persuasion. Id; see also Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). Finally, the Plaintiff has the opportunity to demonstrate that the employer's stated reason for the adverse employment action was pretextual. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804-05; Blue v. Widnall, 162 F.3d 541, 545-46 (9th Cir. 1998); see also Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. 90, 100-01, 123 S. Ct. 2148, 156 L. Ed. 2d 84 (2003). When the plaintiff has established a prima facie case of discrimination, "very little evidence" of discriminatory motive is necessary [*7]  to raise a genuine issue of fact as to pretext. Warren III v. City of Carlsbad, 58 F.3d 439, 443 (9th Cir. 1995). However, the plaintiff cannot rely on generalizations; she must produce evidence of facts that either directly show a discriminatory motive or indirectly show that the defendant's explanation of its actions is not credible. Desert Palace, 539 U.S. at 100; Chuang v. Univ. of Calif. Davis, Bd. of Trs., 225 F.3d 1115, 1124 (9th Cir. 2000); Warren III, 58 F.3d at 443.
Plaintiff here argues that there is direct evidence of discriminatory animus, because of statements made by Ms. Wade, the school's director, in her deposition. (Pl.'s Resp. at 9-10.) "Because Kelly Wade admitted that a teacher with a visual impairment could not be an effective teacher, a McDonnell Douglas burden shifting protocol is unnecessary," Plaintiff states. (Id.) Plaintiff cites Bates v. UPS, 511 F.3d 974 (9th Cir. 2007) in support of this contention. The court in Bates examined United Parcel Service's requirement that all drivers meet the Department of Transportation's ("DOT") hearing standard, although the DOT only implements the standard for drivers of vehicles weighing at least 10,001 pounds. 511 F.3d at 983. The Bates court concluded that the hearing standard at issue in that case constituted "a facially discriminatory qualification standard because it focuse[d] directly on an individual's disabling or potentially disabling condition." Id. at 987. Bates is inapposite [*8]  to the instant case, though, because Defendant applied no such qualification standard in hiring Plaintiff. The job description for Plaintiff's position states, "Specific vision abilities required by this job include close vision, distance vision, color vision, peripheral vision, depth perception, and ability to adjust focus." (DSOF, Ex. C.) Nevertheless, Plaintiff was offered the position, whereas the drivers in Bates were not considered for any positions, even those involving vehicles weighing less than 10,0001 pounds.
Further, Defendant has not admitted taking account of disability status, which the Bates court said was required to dispense with the McDonnell Douglas framework. 511 F.3d at 987. Plaintiff has overstated Ms. Wade's testimony. Ms. Wade testified in her deposition:
Q: Let me ask you a tough question. Do you think you have to see to teach?
A: Yes.
Q: Really?
A: Yes.
Q: So if you can't see, you can't teach is your position?
A: Not effectively.
Q: And why do you say that, ma'am?
A: Because when you teach, you have to show a concept using a chalkboard and different apparatus and you have to be able to model and show and be able to see student work and be able to make corrections. So if you can't [*9]  see what they are doing, then you can't make corrections.
Q: So a person who is blind you think is deprived from being an effective teacher in your estimation?
A: No.
Q: Well, didn't you just tell me that you had to be able to see to teach?
A: If you have accommodations, then I don't know what those would be if you are blind.
Q: Whose obligation is it to provide accommodations for someone who is blind, do you know?
A: It's either party, they can bring it with them or we would provide what they need. Just like we would anyone.
(PSOF, Ex. 6 18:10-19:10.) These statements do not constitute an admission that Defendant took Plaintiff's disability into account in making the employment decision. Not only did Ms. Wade qualify her statement by saying that a person who could not see would require accommodation, the simple fact remains that Plaintiff is not entirely visually impaired. "Plaintiff has monocular vision and cannot see out of both eyes, with limited peripheral vision and the ability to see only lights and shadows in her right eye." (PSOF ¶ 7.) Ms. Wade answered a question about a person who was blind, not a person with partial vision. The Court will, therefore, apply the burden-shifting [*10]  scheme outlined in McDonnell Douglas in this case.

1. Prima Facie Case
To establish a prima facie case under the ADA, Plaintiff "must first demonstrate that: (1) [s]he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) [s]he is a qualified individual able to perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation; and (3) [s]he suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability." Allen v. Pac. Bell, 348 F.3d 1113, 1114 (9th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted); see also Nunes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 164 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir. 1999) (applying this prima facie structure in case alleging improper discharge); Kennedy v. Applause, Inc., 90 F.3d 1477, 1481 (9th Cir. 1996) (same). Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot succeed in making out a prima facie case because she "cannot establish two key elements of her disability claim: (1) that she was performing her job satisfactorily; and (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action based on her disability." (Def.'s Mot. at 9.) Plaintiff responds that Defendant "failed to initiate and engage in good faith in the interactive process to determine the essential functions of Plaintiff's job . . . and to further determine what . . . accommodations might be necessary to permit Plaintiff to successfully perform her job." (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Mot. ("Pl.'s Resp.") at 3.)
Plaintiff's teaching was assessed [*11]  in two ways: (1) classroom observations, followed by informal discussions and (2) formal written evaluations. (Def.'s Mot. at 10; DSOF ¶¶ 9-48, Exs. E-H, J-L.) During Plaintiff's classroom observations, which took place on September 18, 21, 22 and 27, 2006, Assistant Principal Bill Taylor noted a number of problems with Plaintiff's teaching style and techniques. (DSOF, Exs. E-H.) On one occasion, Mr. Taylor noted that Plaintiff seemed "scattered and undirected," that students were blurting out instead of waiting to be called on, that there was "lots of dead time" and "fooling around," and that two students were wrestling in the back of the room. (DSOF, Ex. F.) At the next observation, although Mr. Taylor noted that "students were on task and supported" during the lesson, he still reported that Plaintiff needed to "reduce blurt outs" and "enhance [her] lesson plan." (DSOF, Ex. G.) Later, Mr. Taylor observed that there was "no behavioral support for talking out — lots of blurting out" in the classroom and that "students need to be productive[ly] managed during paper checkin[g] time." (DSOF, Ex. H.)
Plaintiff's formal evaluations also reflect reservations about her abilities as a kindergarten [*12]  teacher. (DSOF, Exs. J-K.) In Plaintiff's first evaluation, dated October 6, 2006, she received 70/74 possible points, with "needs improvement" marks in four areas, including "actively engages most of the students most of the time." (DSOF, Ex. J.) Plaintiff received another formal evaluation dated March 20, 2007, in which she received 66/74 points and "needs improvement" marks in eight categories, again including "actively engages most of the students most of the time," as well as a variety of classroom management areas. (DSOF, Ex. K.) The second evaluation also notes that Plaintiff needs "improvement with following through with discipline plan. Students call out without consequence." (DSOF, Ex. K at 0043.) Plaintiffs evaluation scores place her as the lowest-performing kindergarten teacher at the school for the 2006-07 school year. (DSOF ¶¶ 42-43, Exs. J-L.)
Plaintiff responds that she "did not request any significant accommodation because she believed that as a new teacher she was performing adequately" and that she "was promised a mentoring teacher who never appeared." (Pl.'s Resp. at 3.) Plaintiff also argues that she "was saddled with a classroom aide who was constantly undercutting [*13]  her" and that she had no reason to believe she was underperforming because she received the maximum performance bonus in the spring semester, 2007. (Id.) Plaintiff further states that her interactions with students and parents were positive and that her students made "decent progress" during the year. (PSOF ¶¶ 96, 105, Ex. 7.) Plaintiff submits that her supervising teacher "spoke glowingly of her collegiality [and] her teaching skills." (Pl.'s Resp. at 5.) Regardless of these justifications, the evidence is clear that Plaintiff did not meet the empirical standards set by the school. The Court concludes that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff was performing her job satisfactorily: she was not.
Moreover, Defendant argues that none of the three alleged acts of discrimination constitutes an adverse employment action on the basis of her disability. (Def.'s Mot. at 10-11.) A "tangible employment action constitutes a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits." Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 761, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1998). Neither Plaintiff's alleged exclusion from [*14]  the group computer training class (and her subsequent one-on-one training) nor her colleague's statement that she could not conduct pre-assessment testing because of her vision constitutes an adverse employment action for the purposes of the ADA. An employment action is discriminatory if it limits, segregates, or classifies an employee because of that person's disability in a way that adversely affects the employee's opportunities. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(1). Plaintiff received individualized computer training that she admits was to help her overcome "technical" difficulties unrelated to her disability. (DSOF, Ex. A 25:19.) Also, Plaintiff testified at her deposition that every time she asked for help with the computer program, she received it, so she was not limited by not participating in the group training. (Id. at 25:24-26:1.) The second incident involved a comment by another teacher that Plaintiff could not conduct pre-assessment teaching because "the print was too small." (Id. at 145:11-23.) Plaintiff did not inform school officials about the comment. (Id. at 145:24-146:9.) Stray remarks, even when made by supervisors, are not enough to establish discrimination when they are unrelated to any employment [*15]  decisions. Merrick v. Farmers Ins. Group, 892 F.2d 1434, 1438 (9th Cir. 1990). In this case, the statement by the other teacher cannot constitute an adverse employment action for the purposes of Plaintiff's claim.1

2. Legitimate Nondiscriminatory Reason
Defendant advances that, even if Plaintiff were able to make out a prima facie case of disability discrimination, the decision not to renew her contract was based on her poor performance and not illegal discrimination. (Def.'s Mot. at 12-13.) Evaluation scores of 70/74 in the fall semester and 66/74 in the spring semester support Defendant's contention that Plaintiff's contract was not renewed "[b]ased on Plaintiff's performance deficiencies." (Def.'s Mot. at 5.) Poor performance is a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for an employer to make an adverse employment decision. Aragon v. Republic Silver State Disposal, Inc., 292 F.3d 654, 661 (9th Cir. 2002). The Court concludes that Defendant has produced a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for not renewing Plaintiff's contract, namely that she did not meet the school's expectations for a kindergarten teacher.

3. Pretext
Even if she had established a prima facie case, to survive a motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff would need to come forward with evidence that Defendant's stated reason for not renewing her contract was actually [*16]  pretext. Desert Palace, 539 U.S. at 100; McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804. Plaintiff argues that "[i]ndirect evidence of [her] acceptable performance can be inferred from the fact that [she] received generally good marks on her final evaluation . . . and the top performance bonus available at Defendant school." (Pl.'s Resp. at 15-16.) Plaintiff advances that Ms. Wade's statements at her deposition and her remark about "fitting in" are "[d]irect evidence of discriminatory animus." (Pl.'s Resp. at 16.) With respect to Plaintiff's arguments about indirect evidence, Plaintiff still cannot overcome the fact that her scores were the lowest of all the school's kindergarten teachers and that her scores on her evaluations reflected that she did not meet the school's expectations in a number of categories. The mere fact that she received what Plaintiff alleges was the maximum possible performance bonus does not undercut the substantial evidence of Plaintiff's poor performance.
As discussed above, Ms. Wade's deposition testimony does not amount to direct evidence of discriminatory animus. "Direct evidence is evidence which, if believed, proves the fact [of discriminatory animus] without inference or presumption. . . . [D]irect evidence of employment discrimination [*17]  is rare." Aragon, 292 F.3d at 662 (internal citations omitted). The Court has concluded that Ms. Wade's testimony does not rise to this level. Ms. Wade's remark at the meeting during which she informed Plaintiff that the contract would not be renewed, about "fitting in," is also not enough to support even an inference of discriminatory animus, particularly when standing alone. Moreover, even assuming arguendo that the remark was an act of distinction, discrimination or restriction because Plaintiff has a disability, generally a stray comment cannot be the basis for a discrimination claim. See, e.g., Coleman v. Quaker Oats Co., 232 F.3d 1271, 1284-85 (9th Cir. 2000) (deciding that employer's use of the words "young and promotable" was not sufficient to raise a question of fact as to pretext in age discrimination case); Nesbit v. Pepsico, Inc., 994 F.2d 703, 705 (9th Cir. 1993) (comments by supervisor and company president that "we don't necessarily like grey hair" and "we don't want unpromotable fifty-year olds" around found insufficient for purposes of age discrimination case); Merrick v. Farmers Ins. Group, 892 F.2d 1434, 1438 (9th Cir. 1990) (stray comments insufficient for Title VII purposes, to establish discrimination); Medina v. Multaler, Inc., 547 F. Supp. 2d 1099, 1107 n.13 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (noting that stray comments do not give rise to triable issues regarding discriminatory intent).2
Further, Defendant responds that low-scoring teachers without disabilities [*18]  were treated similarly, pointing to the two other teachers whose contracts were not renewed after the 2006-07 school year. (Def.'s Mot. at 13.) The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that evidence proving that similarly situated employees are treated similarly "negat[es] any showing of pretext." Snead v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1094 (9th Cir. 2001). Defendants also argue that the fact that Ms. Wade made the decision to hire Plaintiff, as well as to not renew her contract, vitiates against a finding of pretext. (Def.'s Mot. at 13.) "[W]here the same actor is responsible for both the hiring and the firing of a discrimination plaintiff, and both actions occur within a short period of time, a strong inference arises that there was no discriminatory motive." Bradley v. Harcourt, Brace & Co., 104 F.3d 267, 270-71 (9th Cir. 1996). Considering all the evidence, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to come forward with evidence that Defendant's proffered reason for not renewing her contract was pretextual.
Plaintiff's arguments that Defendant failed to "initiate and engage in good faith in the interactive process" amount to much ado about nothing. (Pl.'s Resp. at 14.) In her Response, Plaintiff advances that Defendant had the obligation to initiate the interactive process with respect to accommodating [*19]  Plaintiff's disability, as well as to continue to engage in ongoing conversations during Plaintiff's employment at the school. (Pl.'s Resp. at 14-15.) "[T]he interactive process is a mandatory rather than a permissive obligation on the part of employers under the ADA and . . . this obligation is triggered by an employee or an employee's representative giving notice of the employee's disability and the desire for accommodation." Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1114 (9th Cir. 2000), vacated on other grounds, 535 U.S. 391, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002) ("The Court of Appeals also correctly held that there was a triable issue of fact precluding the entry of summary judgment with respect to whether petitioner violated the statute by failing to engage in an interactive process concerning respondent's three proposed accommodations . . . . This latter holding is untouched by the Court's opinion today."). The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in Barnett, held, "The shared goal of [employers and employees in the interactive process] is to identify an accommodation that allows the employee to perform the job effectively. Both sides must communicate directly, exchange essential information, and neither side can delay or obstruct the process." 228 F.3d at 1114-15. The relevant agency regulations provide, "To [*20]  determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the qualified individual with a disability in need of the accommodation." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). In the absence of a specific request from the employee, an employer is "required to initiate the interactive process only when an employee is unable to make such a request and the company knows of the existence of the employee's disability." Brown v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 246 F.3d 1182, 1188 (9th Cir. 2001) (internal citation and quotation omitted). "[T]he employer's obligation to engage in the interactive process extends beyond the first attempt at accommodation and continues when the employee asks for a different accommodation or where the employer is aware that the initial accommodation is failing and further accommodation is needed." Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosp. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1138 (9th Cir. 2001).
Plaintiff presented Defendant with a list of requested accommodations on October 9, 2006. (DSOF, Ex. O.) Defendant provided Plaintiff with all her requested accommodations except for installing hooks upon which the children could hang their backpacks, because it was determined that there was not enough space. (Def.'s Mot. at 7; DSOF ¶¶ 80-81.) Plaintiff testified that she spoke with Mr. Taylor about [*21]  her disability on more than one occasion. (DSOF, Ex. A 31:1-32:23.) Plaintiff also testified that she felt she was in the best position to know what she needed to complete her job and that there was nothing she needed that she did not request. (DSOF, Ex. A 52:22-53:5.) It is clear from the evidence that Defendant did engage in the informal interactive process required by the ADA in good faith. Plaintiff's classroom observations and formal evaluations revealed problems with her performance as a teacher, as discussed above, but they did not demonstrate that those problems were on account of her disability or any accommodation thereof. Defendant's criticisms about Plaintiff's troubles with lesson planning and classroom management did not have to do with her vision, so this is not a situation in which the employer was "aware that the initial accommodation is failing and further accommodation is needed." Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1138. The Court finds that Defendant satisfied its obligations under the ADA to engage in the interactive process in good faith.
For these reasons, the Court concludes that even if Plaintiff had successfully made out a prima facie case of disability discrimination, she has failed to produce [*22]  evidence that Defendant's legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for not renewing her contract was pretextual. Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims for discrimination on the basis of her disability and Defendant's Motion is granted.3

III. Conclusion
The Court concludes that Plaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case of disability discrimination. Further, Defendant has advanced a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for not renewing her employment contract, which Plaintiff has not shown was pretext for discriminatory animus.
IT IS ORDERED granting Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 33).
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED directing the Clerk to enter judgment in this matter.
DATED this 10th day of March, 2009.
