Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
This action is before the Court on Defendant Walkin Billboard, LLC's motion for summary judgment on each of Plaintiff's claims. (Doc. 55). Plaintiff Victoria Cherry filed this action on September 22, 2017. (Doc 1). She brings claims against Terminus, her former employer, for disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et. seq.
For the reasons discussed below, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the motion for summary judgment be DENIED.

I. Facts
A. Standards for Presenting Facts at Summary Judgment
Unless otherwise indicated, the Court draws the following facts from Defendant's statement of material, undisputed facts (Doc. 55-1), Plaintiff's statement of additional material, undisputed facts (Doc. [*2]  58-2), and Plaintiff's response to Defendant's statement of material, undisputed facts (Doc. 58-1).1 Where indicated, the Court also draws facts directly from the record. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3) ("The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record."). The Court deems as admitted those facts submitted by Defendant that are supported by citations to record evidence, and for which Plaintiff has not specifically disputed and refuted with citations to admissible record evidence showing a genuine dispute of fact. See LR 56.1(B)(2)(a)(2), NDGa. ("This Court will deem each of the movant's facts as admitted unless the respondent: (i) directly refutes the movant's fact with concise responses supported by specific citations to evidence (including page or paragraph number); (ii) states a valid objection to the admissibility of the movant's fact; or (iii) points out that the movant's citation does not support the movant's fact or that the movant's fact is not material or otherwise has failed to comply with the provisions set out in LR 56.1(B)(1).").
The Court has excluded assertions of fact by either party that are immaterial or presented as arguments or legal conclusions and has excluded assertions [*3]  of fact unsupported by a citation to admissible evidence in the record or asserted only in the party's brief and not in the statement of facts. See LR 56.1 (B)(1), NDGa. ("The Court will not consider any fact: (a) not supported by a citation to evidence...or (d) set out only in the brief and not in the movant's statement of undisputed facts."). The Court has also viewed all of the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as it is required to do on a defendant's motion for summary judgment. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1560 (11th Cir. 1994); Reynolds v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 989 F.2d 465, 469 (11th Cir. 1993).
Plaintiff disputes some of Defendant's proffered facts, but some of these objections are about matters that are not necessarily material to the disposition of this case. The Court will not therefore rule on every objection or dispute presented, but will discuss those objections in the analysis section only when necessary.
B. Material Facts
1. Terminus
Terminus is a screen-printing company owned equally by Mark Hanson and Jon Ladd. (Doc. 58-1 at ¶¶ 1-3). Terminus has five printing presses that it uses to print merchandise, which are operated by a printing team consisting of three people: a printer, a printer's assistant, and someone performing quality control. Id. at ¶¶ 6, 15. Employees [*4]  are frequently moved around among the three positions. Id. at ¶ 17; (see also Doc. 55-3 at 59).
In Terminus' employee handbook, the disability accommodation policy states:
[Terminus] is committed to complying fully with applicable disability laws and ensuring equal opportunity in employment for qualified persons with disabilities. Reasonable accommodation is available to all disabled employees, where their disability affects the performance of job functions to the extent required by law....This policy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. [Terminus] is committed to taking all other actions necessary to ensure equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance with the ADA and all other applicable federal, state, and local laws.
(Doc. 58-8 at 8). The parties dispute whether the enforcement of this policy requires that the employee provide a doctor's note to prove a disability or the need for accommodation. (Doc. 58-1 at ¶ 21). Whether or not a doctor's note is required, once Terminus has been notified of the disability, the company's policy is to allow that employee to take time off without any questions. Id. at ¶ 23. Terminus does not require employees to provide [*5]  a specific diagnosis of their condition before it considers accommodation requests. Id. at ¶ 24. Terminus' managers are instructed to send employees with accommodation requests to Haley Putman, Terminus' head of Human Resources, and coordinate with her regarding those accommodations. Id. at ¶¶ 4, 26, 28.
2. Plaintiff's Employment at Terminus
Plaintiff first worked for Terminus as a temporary employee from August to October of 2015. (Doc. 58-1 at ¶ 9). Terminus hired her as a permanent employee on or about December 7, 2015. Id. at ¶ 10. During her time at Terminus, Plaintiff worked in all three positions of the printing team, beginning in the quality control position, then moving to printer's assistant, and later to printer. Id. at ¶¶ 11-13. Brad Newberry, Plaintiff's supervisor, described her as a "great worker" and a "good employee." (Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 5, 8; Doc. 54 at 20, 39).
Plaintiff suffers from bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, an anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. (Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 9; Doc. 58-9 at 6). Terminus allowed Plaintiff to take breaks when she was having a "spell" or a "flare-up." (Doc. 55-1 at ¶ 38; Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 15; Doc. 53 at 45; Doc. 54 at 15-18). These [*6]  "flare-ups" could rise to crippling levels resulting in a "meltdown"—such as one instance where Plaintiff collapsed on the floor crying. (Doc. 58-2 at ¶¶ 10, 11; Doc. 54 at 18). Plaintiff, in a declaration, describes that during these breaks she might "walk outside and look at the sky, check social media or text messages on her phone, talk to others, or any other activity that helped her calm down and ease her anxiety." (Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 16). The parties disagree about whether Plaintiff was required to request permission from her supervisor prior to taking a break. (Doc. 58-1 at ¶ 40; Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 21).
3. Hospitalization and Return to Work
Throughout her employment, Plaintiff missed work at least twice a month for therapy sessions. (Doc.58-1 at ¶ 54). She was never penalized for missing work for going to therapy. (Doc. 58-1 at ¶ 55; Doc. 55-3 at ¶ 43). On February 13, 2017, Plaintiff voluntarily admitted herself to Anchor Hospital, which is part of Southern Crescent Behavioral Health System, because she was experiencing suicidal ideation and unstable psychiatric symptoms. (Doc. 58-1 at ¶ 52; Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 29). She was discharged from Anchor Hospital three days later on February 16, [*7]  2017. (Doc. 58-1 at ¶ 53). Plaintiff returned to work on February 20, 2017, and she provided her hospital discharge papers to Haley Putman. Id. at ¶¶ 56, 57. The discharge paperwork included information about the medications that she was taking, including Prozac, Xanax, Lamictral, Vistaril, and Klonopin. Id. at ¶ 58.
When Plaintiff returned to work on February 20, 2017, she was placed in a quality control position. Id. at ¶ 59. Terminus contends that Plaintiff was moved back to the press operator position in the afternoon of February 20, 2017, while Plaintiff maintains that she stayed in the quality control position for the remainder of her employment. Id. at ¶¶ 60, 62.
4. The End of Plaintiff's Employment
Plaintiff's last day of employment with Terminus was on February 28, 2017. (Doc. 58-1 at ¶¶ 71-88). The parties vigorously dispute the events of that day and, most specifically, whether Plaintiff was fired or whether she quit.
a. Defendant's Version of Events
Defendant's description of the day begins with Plaintiff walking away from her position in the middle of a job, without asking for permission, which affected production. (Doc. 55-1 at ¶¶ 73, 76). Defendant maintains that Plaintiff [*8]  told Newberry, her supervisor, that she "did not want to catch shirts anymore and she was through." Id. at ¶ 78. Newberry then brought Plaintiff upstairs to Jon Ladd's office, where she repeatedly stated that she wanted to quit. Id. at ¶¶ 80, 82. Ladd gave Plaintiff the opportunity to rethink quitting and come back later that day, but Plaintiff refused and continued to state that she was quitting. Id. at ¶¶ 83, 84. Plaintiff left Ladd's office and walked to the back-bay doors. Id. at ¶ 85. Hanson, who was away from Terminus when these events occurred, encountered Plaintiff at the back-bay doors and accepted her resignation. (Doc. 55-1 at ¶¶ 86-88).
b. Plaintiff's Version of Events
Plaintiff says that she walked away from her position for a break (after her portion of the job was done) on the morning of February 28, 2017. (Doc. 58-2 at ¶¶ 37, 38). She maintains that she waited for a pause in production, notified the head printer that she was taking a break, and then left the building, all without notifying Newberry, just as she had done with numerous breaks in the past. (Doc. 58-2 at ¶¶ 38-40).
During this break, Plaintiff went to another building and spoke to a coworker. (Doc. 58-2 at [*9]  ¶ 39). Newberry then told Plaintiff to get back to work. Id. at ¶ 41. Despite being told she was taking a break for a flare-up, Newberry refused to listen and kept telling her to return to work. Id. at ¶ 42.
Newberry then took Plaintiff to meet with Putman, who then took them both to Ladd's office. (Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 46). Plaintiff did not state during this meeting that she wanted to quit, id. at ¶ 47; she did, however, state that she suffered from bipolar disorder and needed to take breaks to calm down, id. at ¶ 48. At the end of the meeting, Ladd instructed Plaintiff to go to lunch, and Newberry walked her out. Id. at ¶ 50. Ladd did not consider Plaintiff's employment to be over at the end of this meeting. Id. at ¶ 51.
During her lunch period, Plaintiff stood by the back-bay doors, where she met Hanson. (Doc. 58-1 at ¶¶ 85, 87-88; Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 52). At this encounter, Plaintiff alleges that Hanson "fired" her, told her that she was being terminated for "walking off the job," and told her to "get off my property." (Doc. 58-2 at ¶¶ 54, 55). Plaintiff alleges that a non-disabled employee named Philip was allowed to walk away from the job without getting into trouble. Id. at ¶ 56.

II. SUMMARY [*10]  JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment is authorized when the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show "that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986); Baas v. Fewless, 886 F.3d 1088, 1091 (11th Cir. 2018). The movant carries this burden by showing the court "that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. In making its determination, the court must view the evidence and all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Crane v. Lifemark Hospitals, Inc., 898 F.3d 1130, 1134 (11th Cir. 2018).
Once the moving party has adequately supported its motion, the non-moving party must come forward with specific facts that demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986). The non-moving party is required "to go beyond the pleadings" and to present competent evidence designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324 (internal quotation marks omitted). Generally, "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" supporting the non-moving party's case is insufficient to defeat a motion [*11]  for summary judgment; rather, there must be evidence on which a jury could reasonably find for the non-moving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986). The non-moving party cannot defeat summary judgment by relying upon conclusory assertions. See Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1564 n. 6 (11th Cir. 1997). Rather, "[a] party asserting that a fact...is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by...citing to particular parts of materials in the record." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A); see also Resolution Trust Corp. v. Dunmar Corp., 43 F.3d 587, 599 (11th Cir. 1995) (en banc) ("There is no burden upon the district court to distill every potential argument that could be made based upon the materials before it on summary judgment.").
If a fact is found to be material, the court must also consider the genuineness of the alleged factual dispute. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50. A factual dispute is not genuine if it is unsupported by evidence, or if it is created by evidence that is "merely colorable" or is "not significantly probative." Id. A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. at 248. Moreover, for factual issues to be genuine, they must have a real basis in the record. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. The non-moving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Id. at 586. "Where the record taken as a whole could [*12]  not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial." Id. at 587 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the standard for summary judgment mirrors that for a directed verdict: "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 259 (internal quotation marks omitted).
When considering motions for summary judgment, the court does not make decisions as to the merits of disputed factual issues. See id. at 249; Ryder Int'l Corp. v. First Am. Nat'l Bank, 943 F.2d 1521, 1523 (11th Cir. 1991). Rather, the court only determines whether there are genuine issues of material fact to be tried. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. A genuine issue for trial can be created solely by the testimony of a party, even if that testimony is self-serving. Feliciano v. City of Miami Beach, 707 F.3d 1244, 1247, 1253 (11th Cir. 2013). Additionally, "[i]f there is a conflict between the parties' allegations or evidence, the non-moving party's evidence is presumed to be true and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the non-moving party's favor." Allen v. Bd. of Pub. Educ. for Bibb Cty., 495 F.3d 1306, 1314 (11th Cir. 2007). Applicable substantive law identifies those facts that are material and those that are irrelevant. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Disputed facts that do not resolve or affect the outcome of a suit will not preclude the entry of summary [*13]  judgment. Id.

III. DISCUSSION
Defendant moves for summary judgment on all counts in Plaintiff's complaint. In Count I, Plaintiff brings an ADA disparate-treatment discrimination claim alleging that Defendant terminated her employment and subjected her to terms and conditions of employment different than non-disabled individuals. (Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 55, 58-59). In Count II, Plaintiff brings an ADA failure-to-accommodate claim alleging that Defendant refused to allow her to continue taking periodic breaks after her hospitalization. Id. at ¶¶ 73, 76. In Count III, Plaintiff brings an ADA retaliation claim alleging that Defendant terminated her in retaliation for requesting an accommodation and asking for medical leave. Id. at ¶¶ 89-91.
The ADA prohibits an employer from "discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on the basis of disability" concerning hiring, promotion, discharge, compensation, training, job application procedures, or "other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The definition of discriminate includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of a qualified individual with a disability unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation [*14]  would impose an undue hardship. Id. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
"[T]here are two distinct categories of disability discrimination claims under the ADA: (1) failure to accommodate and (2) disparate treatment." E.E.O.C. v. Eckerd Corp., No. 1:10-CV-2816-JEC, 2012 WL 2568225, at *4 (N.D. Ga. July 2, 2012). And the ADA also "prohibits retaliation against an individual for opposing an unlawful practice or making a charge under the ADA." Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a)).
Courts examine ADA disparate-treatment claims under the burden-shifting framework set out in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004); Wascura v. City of S. Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001); Meade v. General Motors LLC, 317 F. Supp. 3d 1259, 1273 (N.D. Ga. 2018). The initial burden is on the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Cleveland, 369 F.3d at 1193. The burden then shifts to the defendant to produce a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the termination or other adverse employment action. Id. The burden then returns to the plaintiff to show that this reason is unworthy of credence and a pretext for discrimination. Id.
The McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, however, "is not applicable to reasonable accommodation cases." Nadler v. Harvey, No. 06-12692, 2007 WL 2404705, at * 9 (11th Cir. Aug. 24, 2007); see also Holly v. Clairson Indus., LLC, 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007) (noting that for a failure-to-accommodate claim, there are no "subsequent burdens on [defendant] to show that it had any legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for terminating [plaintiff] or on [plaintiff] to establish that these reasons were pretextual") (internal quotation marks omitted); [*15]  Cappetta v. N. Fulton Eye Center, No. 1:15-CV-3412-LMM-JSA, 2017 WL 5197207, at *19 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 1, 2017) ("For those cases in which an employee claims that an employer violated the ADA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for the employee's disability, however, the Eleventh Circuit has held that the McDonnell Douglas Corp. burden-shifting framework does not apply."), adopted by 2017 WL 5443877 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 7, 2017); Haines v. Cherokee Cty., No. 1:08-CV-2916-JOF/AJB, 2010 WL 2821853, at *9 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 16, 2010) ("Although the McDonnell Douglas framework applies to disparate treatment claims under the ADA, the McDonnell Douglas framework is inapplicable in failure to accommodate cases under the ADA."), adopted as modified by 2010 WL 2821780 (N.D. Ga. July 15, 2010); Jones v. Ga. Dep't of Corr., No. 1:07-CV-1228-RLV, 2008 WL 779326, at *6 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 18, 2008) ("The Eleventh Circuit came to the logical conclusion that the McDonnell Douglas test does not apply to reasonable accommodation claims in [Nadler], but it inexplicably did not publish the opinion and provide trial courts with a clear answer to this previously unaddressed issue."). "Instead, a plaintiff establishes a reasonable accommodation claim by proving a prima facie case of disability discrimination." Haines, 2010 WL 2821853, at *9; see also Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262-63; Nadler, 2007 WL 2404705, at *9. And finally, for ADA retaliation claims, the full burden-shifting analysis of McDonnell Douglas applies. Batson v. Salvation Army, 897 F.3d 1320, 1328-29 (11th Cir. 2018). The Court will analyze each claim in turn.
A. Count I — Disparate Treatment
Count I of Plaintiff's complaint alleges disparate treatment in her termination, that is, that she was treated differently (by being terminated) than those employees outside [*16]  of her protected class because of her disability. Under a disparate-treatment theory, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination by showing the following: "(1) he is disabled; (2) he is a qualified individual; and (3) he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of his disability." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1255-56; Cappetta, 2017 WL 5197207, at *21.
Defendant does not contest the first two prongs—it does not argue that Plaintiff is not disabled or that she is not a qualified individual. Rather, Defendant argues for summary judgment on Count I by asserting that Plaintiff cannot establish the third prong of her prima facie case. (See Doc. 55-2 at 5). Specifically, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot show that she suffered an adverse employment action because she was not terminated. See id. at 6. Defendant says that she quit. Id.
Defendant additionally argues that it did not treat other employees outside of Plaintiff's protected class differently. (See Doc. 55-2 at 7). Defendant asserts that its "pattern and practice was to accommodate each and every one of its employees." (Doc. 55-2 at 7). Defendant states that it accommodated Plaintiff by permitting her to take any break she requested and by allowing her to go to any doctor [*17]  visit, as long as she brought a doctor's note. Id.
In response, Plaintiff argues first that summary judgment is improper because she has presented a "convincing mosaic" of circumstantial evidence of discrimination. (Doc. 58 at 5). Plaintiff offers the "convincing mosaic" theory as an alternative to Defendant's argument under McDonnell Douglas, while also arguing that she survives summary judgment under the traditional McDonnell Douglas analysis. Id. at 5-21. However, she offers many of the same facts under both theories. See id. at 20. Specific to the "convincing mosaic" theory, Plaintiff argues that a reasonable jury could infer discrimination from the suspicious timing of her termination—she argues that Defendant fired her shortly after learning more details about her disability. Id. at 7-11. And she argues that Defendant uses the "resignation" excuse as a pretext for firing her. Id. at 12-16. Plaintiff argues that the evidence "leaves no room for the possibility that Defendant honestly, but mistakenly, believed she resigned." Id. at 13.
Plaintiff also argues that summary judgment is improper under the McDonnell Douglas framework because she properly set forth a prima facie case. As to Defendant's argument that she did not suffer an [*18]  adverse employment action, Plaintiff relies on the same arguments that she made in the "convincing mosaic" portion of her brief noting that she was fired and that she did not resign (Doc. 58 at 20-21).
In reply, Defendant argues that summary judgment is appropriate "because no reasonable finder of fact, taking the testimonies of Mr. Newberry, Ms. Putman, and Mr. Ladd against that of Plaintiff, could reasonably determine that Plaintiff did anything but voluntarily quit her job." (Doc. 59 at 2). Defendant emphasizes the evidence in its favor: Defendant allowed Plaintiff to take time off, provided many accommodations, allowed her to miss work at least twice a month for therapy, and allowed her to return to work after her hospitalization. (Doc. 59 at 4). Additionally, Defendant points out that three witnesses who were present at the February 28 meeting all testified that Plaintiff voluntarily quit. (Doc. 59 at 6). Defendant succinctly sums up its reply argument: "The Court need not weigh evidence here—it is clear that the record is so one-sided in demonstrating that Plaintiff resigned her employment, no reasonable fact finder could find in favor of Plaintiff." (Doc. 59 at 6-7).

1. The McDonnell [*19]  Douglas Framework
As noted above, under the ADA, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination by showing the following: "(1) he is disabled; (2) he is a qualified individual; and (3) he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of his disability." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1255-56. The only prong that Defendant challenges is the third—whether Plaintiff was subject to unlawful discrimination. That prong requires a plaintiff to show that she suffered an adverse employment action. See Cappetta, 2017 WL 5197207, at *24. An adverse employment action is one in which the plaintiff "suffered 'a serious and material change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.'" Ward v. United Parcel Service, 987 F. Supp. 2d 1240, 1262-63 (N.D. Ala. 2013) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 970-71 (11th Cir. 2008)). "A complainant's termination from employment, of course, qualifies as an 'adverse employment action' under the ADA." Massey v. Retirement Corp. of America Partners, L.P., No. 1:12-CV-2949-CAP, 2014 WL 11820251, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 19, 2014).
Here, because Defendant does not contest the first two prongs of the prima facie case, (see Doc. 55-2 at 5-9), the only question is whether there is any material dispute of fact about whether Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action. Defendant has the burden to show the absence of a material dispute and tries to do so on this count solely by showing that Plaintiff voluntarily resigned.2
The parties fundamentally [*20]  disagree about whether Plaintiff resigned or was terminated. (Compare Doc. 58 at 11 with Doc. 55-2 at 6-7). Plaintiff's testimony unequivocally asserts that she did not quit and was fired, while Defendant cites three witnesses who claim that Plaintiff quit. The evidence could not be any more in dispute. The relevant players who observed the events during the late morning of February 28, 2017 (the meeting that stretched between Putman's office and Ladd's office, and the conversation between Hanson and Plaintiff by the back-bay doors), are Plaintiff, her supervisor Brad Newberry, HR Manager Haley Putman, and co-owners Jon Ladd and Mark Hanson. The Court summarizes the deposition testimony from each:
Brad Newberry: Newberry testified that Plaintiff told him that "she did not want to catch shirts anymore and she was through." (Doc. 54 at 26). He walked with Plaintiff up to Ladd's office, where "[s]he kept on saying that she was through with this and she wants to quit." Id. at 27-28. Newberry then walked downstairs with her, and he went to lunch. Id. at 28-29.
Haley Putman: Putman testified that Plaintiff and Newberry arrived in her office and Plaintiff was "saying I quit. I quit. I quit. [*21]  I'm not doing this anymore. I quit." (Doc. 53 at 51). Putman tried to calm Plaintiff down and then moved everyone into Ladd's adjoining office (there were other people in Putman's office when Plaintiff and Newberry arrived). Id. at 52-53. When they got into Ladd's office, Putman testified that Plaintiff said, "I'm done." Id. at 54. Ladd then said, "what are you done with, or something along those lines. And she said I quit. I'm not doing this anymore." Id. at 55. Putman testified that Ladd tried to deescalate things, and Plaintiff "wasn't hearing it." Id. Ladd asked if Plaintiff was "done for the day, or are you done all together. Are you quitting. Are you resigning. And she said I'm just done. And she just never really gave a definitive." Id. Then Ladd asked if Plaintiff would be back after lunch, and she said, "I'm done. I quit. And she put her book bag on and walked out the door and Brad [Newberry] followed her." Id. at 55.
Jonn Ladd: Ladd remembers that Plaintiff was in his office, that she was upset, and that she viewed working in quality control "as a demotion of sorts." (Doc. 51 at 85-86).
And then she went into, I just don't know if I really want to work here anymore. And I was [*22]  like, I want you to be happy. And then at the end of the conversation I just told her do you have —if I recall I think they were about to go on break or maybe lunch at that time, so take that time; you know, do what you need to do, think about that. And then she went on break and was still angry, talking to other employees and saying she was going to quit, going to quit. The next thing I heard, that she was gone.
Id. at 86.
Mark Hanson: Hanson testified that he was not present during the meeting in Ladd's office. (Doc. 52 at 145). He returned to the office and talked to Plaintiff by the bay door. Id. He said to Plaintiff, "I talked to the manager, I understand you quit, I accept your resignation." Id.
Victoria Cherry:
Q: And you told Brad Newberry you were quitting; correct?
A: No, sir.
Q: You told Jon Ladd?
A: No, sir.
Q: You told Mark Hanson?
A: No, sir.
Q: You told—did you ever tell Haley [Putman] that you were thinking about quitting?
A: No, sir.
...
Q: Okay. And Mark [Hanson] told you that he accepted your resignation; isn't that correct?
A: No, sir.
...
Q: Okay. And you're saying that Mark Hanson told you you were fired; is that correct?
A: Yes, sir.
Q: Okay. And you're aware that Mark Hanson [*23]  says that he accepted your resignation.
A: Yes, sir.
...
Q: Okay. Did you state over and over that you were quitting?
A: No, sir.
...
Q: Okay. And who told you you were fired?
A: Mark Hanson.
Q: He actually used the word fired?
A: Yes.
Q: Okay.
A: His exact words were, you're fired. Get off my property.
(Doc. 58-9 at 9-11, 16).
As it must at summary judgment, the Court resolves this conflict by presuming that Plaintiff's evidence is true and that she was fired. See Allen, 495 F.3d at 1314. Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because there was no adverse employment action, and on this issue the testimony is hopelessly conflicted. The fact that the only evidence probative of this fact on the Plaintiff's side is her own self-serving testimony does not change the Court's role at summary judgment to presume conflicting evidence in favor of the non-moving party. See Feliciano, 707 F.3d at 1247, 1253; Allen, 495 F.3d at 1314. Plaintiff's testimony about what she said and what was said to her presents "non-conclusory descriptions of specific, discrete facts of the who, what, when and where variety." Feliciano, 707 F. 3d at 1253. It is based on her "first-hand personal knowledge, not her subjective beliefs." Id. "Courts routinely and properly deny summary judgment on the basis of a party's [*24]  sworn testimony even though it is self-serving." Price v. Time, Inc., 416 F.3d 1327, 1345 (11th Cir. 2005).
Plaintiff cites three district court cases that deny summary judgment where there were disputes about whether the employee resigned or was fired. (Doc. 58 at 13-16). For example, in Jackson v. Dunn Constr. Co., an employer claimed that it terminated an employee because it believed that he intended to resign. 927 F. Supp. 2d 1229, 1238 (N.D. Ala. 2013). The employee, however, asserted that he did not intend to resign but told the employer that he would stay if his concerns about discrimination were addressed. Id. at 1239. In denying the employer's motion for summary judgment, the court stated that to grant summary judgment, "the court would have to ignore [the employee's] contention that he purportedly told [the employer] that he wanted to stay...and would stay if [the employer] addressed [his] complaints...and conclude instead that [the employer] presented a more credible version of the facts." Id. Such a conclusion would "result in a clear error since it is hornbook law that a court cannot make credibility determinations at the summary judgment stage." Id. The facts are similar here.
Defendant states in its reply brief that no "reasonable finder of fact" could determine that Plaintiff [*25]  "did anything but voluntarily quit her job." (Doc. 59 at 2).3 But Plaintiff's testimony says exactly the opposite—that she was fired—and a jury might well believe her. Or maybe not. Either way, it is not a fact that the Court can resolve at this stage.
Those cases that prohibit a party from defeating summary judgment by relying on self-serving statements, see e.g., Locascio v. Bbdo Atlanta, Inc., No. 1:14-CV-207-MHC, 2016 WL 7334647, at *1 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 9, 2016), "involve situations where the plaintiff is making conclusory allegations that are not supported by personal knowledge," Connelly v. Metro. Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., No. 1:11-CV-2108-TWT-GGB, 2012 WL 6765579, at *9 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 7, 2012), adopted by 2013 WL 56096 (Jan. 3. 2013). Where, on the other hand, "the plaintiff is describing events that [s]he personally witnessed or conversations that [s]he participated in, a court must accept that testimony as true for summary judgment purposes." Id.
Here the parties offer alternate versions of the facts. At summary judgment, the Court cannot conclude that Defendant's version is more credible. See id. Defendant's entire summary judgment argument as to Count I rests on the fact that it did not terminate Plaintiff. (See Doc. 55-2 at 5-9).4 Because the facts on this issue are materially in dispute, summary judgment on Count I should be denied.5

2. The "Convincing Mosaic" Theory
Although Plaintiff withstands summary judgment [*26]  under the McDonnell Douglas framework, she also prevails on the alternative "convincing mosaic" theory. Under this theory, a plaintiff survives summary judgment by presenting circumstantial evidence "that creates a triable issue concerning the employer's discriminatory intent." Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011) (holding that "establishing the elements of the McDonnell Douglas framework is not, and never was intended to be, the sine qua non for a plaintiff to survive a summary judgment motion in an employment discrimination case"); Palermo v. Grunau Co., 220 F. Supp. 3d 1300, 1307 (M.D. Fla. 2016) (applying the "convincing mosaic" theory in an ADA case).
Plaintiff offers the suspicious timing between her hospitalization and the withdrawing of her accommodation to support her "convincing mosaic" theory. (Doc. 58 at 6). The parties do not argue the suspiciousness of the timing, rather, the arguments center on whether the accommodation was truly withdrawn. Plaintiff maintains that she was not required to ask permission before taking a disability-related break. (Doc. 58 at 7). Defendant argues that it had always required Plaintiff to request a break from a supervisor before she was allowed to take one. (See Doc. 55-2 at 8, 11; Doc. 59 at 5). This disagreement pits the testimony of Newberry against the testimony of Plaintiff. [*27]  Newberry testified that, when Plaintiff needed to leave the line, she had to see him first: "If you're in the middle of a job, you come and see me....You don't go to anyone else. You come see me like always. She did not do that [on February 28, 2017]." (Doc. 54 at 37) (emphasis added). Plaintiff, on the other hand, stated in her declaration that she was not required "to seek permission from my supervisor (Brad Newberry) or HR (i.e. Haley) before taking a disability break. I regularly took such breaks without notifying them." (Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 21; Doc. 58-6 at ¶15).6 This fact cannot be resolved on summary judgment, and the Court must infer, consistent with Plaintiff's declaration testimony, that she was not previously required to seek permission from a supervisor before taking a disability break.
Plaintiff also offers, in support of the "convincing mosaic" theory, that Defendant's argument that she quit is pretext for its decision to fire her. (Doc. 58 at 12-16). Defendant responds that the evidence strongly supports its position that she quit. (Doc. 59 at 5-7). As noted above, the Court cannot resolve this disputed issue of fact at summary judgment. Plaintiff's arguments under the "convincing [*28]  mosaic" theory involve disputed issues of fact, and Defendant's motion should be denied under this theory as well.
The undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be DENIED with respect to Count I.
B. Count II — Failure to Accommodate
Count II of Plaintiff's complaint brings a failure-to-accommodate claim. (Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 65-81). "To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination based on a failure-to-accommodate, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she is disabled; (2) she was a 'qualified individual' when she suffered the adverse employment action; and (3) that she was discriminated against because of her disability by being denied a reasonable accommodation to allow her to keep working." Cappetta, 2017 WL 5197207, at *25 (citing Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001); Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir. 1999); Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997); Harris v. H&W Contracting Co., 102 F.3d 516, 519 (11th Cir. 1996); Morisky v. Broward Cnty., 80 F.3d 445, 447 (11th Cir. 1996)).7
Defendant argues for summary judgment on Count II under only the third prong, contending that "at-will breaks without first notifying a supervisor" is both an unreasonable accommodation and would constitute an undue hardship. (Doc. 55-2 at 10-11). Defendant does not dispute that this accommodation would allow Plaintiff to perform her job duties, but states that it would be unreasonable to allow such an accommodation because the nature of its business—t-shirt [*29]  printing—means that such a practice would create safety concerns. Id. Moreover, Defendant points out that, subject to the requirement that she notify her supervisor, it gave Plaintiff unlimited breaks, unlimited days off, and did not question her requests for breaks. Id. at 12.
Plaintiff responds that, while Defendant initially provided her the requested accommodation, its failure to accommodate lies in its withdrawal of that accommodation. (Doc. 58 at 23). She states that she "requested an accommodation of breaks to deal with her flare-ups from the beginning of her employment" and "renewed this request during the meeting with Mr. Ladd, Ms. Putman, and Mr. Newberry on the day of her termination." Id. at 22-23. She admits that Defendant initially provided the accommodation, but argues that Defendant later withdrew it. Id. at 23. Again, the nature of the disagreement between the parties centers on whether Plaintiff had to seek permission from her supervisor before taking the break—she alleges that she never had to notify her supervisor before, but that she did have to do so following her return to work from hospitalization. Id. at 22-24. And Plaintiff argues that Defendant failed to engage [*30]  in an interactive process when it terminated her without explaining the reason for its change of position regarding seeking permission from the supervisor. Id. at 23. Plaintiff argues that the accommodation was reasonable and did not create an undue hardship because Defendant had been granting her breaks without seeking permission for years. Id. at 23-24. In reply, Defendant reiterates that all of Plaintiff's breaks in the past have been with notice to her supervisor. (Doc. 59 at 5).
A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of a failure-to-accommodate claim by proving the same three prongs of a prima facie case of a disparate-treatment claim, except that the third prong is proved by showing that the plaintiff "was discriminated against by way of the defendant's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation." See Solloway v. Clayton, 738 F. App'x 985, 987 (11th Cir. 2018) (citing Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001)). "An accommodation is reasonable, and thus required under the ADA, only if it allows the employee to perform the essential function of the job." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000). "[T]he burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified individual to perform the job rests with that individual, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to demonstrating that such an [*31]  accommodation is reasonable." Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 1997). Once a plaintiff meets his burden, the defendant may assert that the reasonable accommodation constitutes an undue hardship as an affirmative defense. Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 286 (11th Cir. 1997); see also Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367 (noting that, "before an employer has a duty to show undue hardship, the plaintiff first must show that a reasonable accommodation exists"); Jernigan v. Bellsouth Telecomms., LLC, 17 F. Supp. 3d 1317, 1321 (N.D. Ga. 2014) ("Upon a showing by the plaintiff that a reasonable accommodation exists, the burden shifts to the employer to prove that the plaintiff's requested accommodation imposes an undue hardship.").
The issues of whether an accommodation is reasonable and whether it poses an undue hardship are not the same: "the question of whether an accommodation is reasonable (though it must be determined within a given set of specific facts) is more of a 'generalized' inquiry than the question of whether an accommodation causes a 'hardship' on the particular employer that is undue." Willis, 108 F.3d at 286 n.2. In proving that the accommodation is reasonable:
a plaintiff/employee (to defeat a defendant/employer's motion for summary judgment) need only show that an "accommodation" seems reasonable on its face, i.e., ordinarily or in the run of cases....Once the plaintiff has made this showing, the defendant/employer [*32]  then must show special (typically case-specific) circumstances that demonstrate undue hardship in the particular circumstances.
U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 402 (2002). A defendant/employer's previous accommodation does not conclusively establish the reasonableness of that accommodation. See Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1257 n.3 (11th Cir. 2001); Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 626 n.6 (11th Cir. 1998).
Again, the only argument Defendant raises as to this claim is with the reasonableness of the requested accommodation. Defendant concedes that Plaintiff has "identified an accommodation that would allow her to perform her job duties." (Doc. 55-2 at 10). Defendant simply argues that allowing Plaintiff to take breaks without first notifying her supervisor creates a safety problem—"an unannounced break in the press might result in injury to another employee." Id. at 11. Plaintiff, on the other hand, counters that this could not be so because Defendant has been permitting such breaks since the start of her employment. (Doc. 58 at 23-24).
The briefing on this issue is somewhat terse. Neither party directly addresses the matter in terms of the essential functions of the job. See Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365 ("An accommodation is reasonable, and thus required under the ADA, only if it allows the employee to perform the essential functions of the job."). In simplest terms, [*33]  Defendant argues that the accommodation (breaks without notifying her supervisor) is unsafe, while Plaintiff argues that is not true because Defendant for years has permitted her to take breaks without notifying her supervisor.
Plaintiff, in her declaration, describes how she took breaks in the past. She states that, from the beginning of her employment, Defendant permitted her to take disability breaks when she experienced a "flare-up." (Doc. 58-6 at ¶ 10). She would attempt to wait for a pause in production and would typically notify her co-workers—"If I was the Printer, I would notify my crew. If I was the Quality Control or a Printer's Assistant, I would notify the Printer." Id. at ¶¶ 13-14. She states that she was not required to seek permission from her supervisor or from Human Resources prior to taking the break, and that she "regularly took such breaks without notifying them." Id. at ¶ 15. Plaintiff readily admits that she did not ask for permission from her supervisor before taking the break on February 28, 2017—her last date of employment. Id. at ¶ 26.
Defendant, on the other hand, argues that while it has always allowed Plaintiff to take breaks, it has only done so after Plaintiff [*34]  first notified and sought permission from her supervisor. (Doc. 55-2 at 10-12; Doc. 59 at 5). As noted above, whether Plaintiff was previously permitted to take breaks without first notifying her supervisor is a material fact that is in dispute. Plaintiff says that she was, Defendant says that she was not. And that fact is central to the reasonable accommodation issue as well. If it is true (and the Court must presume that it is) that Plaintiff has been permitted to take at-will breaks without first notifying a supervisor, then that fact directly contradicts Defendant's assertion that it is unsafe for Plaintiff to take a break without first notifying her supervisor. If, on the other hand, a jury believes Defendant—and finds that Defendant has always required Plaintiff to first notify her supervisor before taking a break—then Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation argument likely fails, because her argument for why it is reasonable is premised on the fact that Defendant has always permitted the practice. Simply put, whether Plaintiff's requested accommodation is reasonable depends on whether that accommodation results in safety concerns—and both parties frame the safety issue by arguing [*35]  about whether Defendant has permitted the practice in the past. Because that material fact is in dispute, the Court is unable to resolve the reasonable accommodation issue without wading into the province of the jury.
To be clear, the Court is not saying that the proposed accommodation (breaks with notifying a supervisor) is per se reasonable because Defendant has permitted that accommodation in the past. See Terrell, 132 F.3d at 626 n.6 (holding that the fact that an employer has tried to previously accommodate an employee with a particular accommodation "does not, by itself, prove the reasonableness of Plaintiff's requested accommodation"). Indeed, whether Defendant has permitted that practice in the past is sharply disputed. Rather, the Court finds that summary judgment is not appropriate as to Count II because the parties frame the reasonableness inquiry in terms of whether the proposed accommodation would create unsafe conditions, and they both answer that question by pointing to what has happened in the past. In short, the Court cannot decide the safety question without resolving the factual dispute about whether Defendant has permitted Plaintiff to take breaks without supervisor notification in the past, [*36]  and that it cannot do at the summary judgment stage. Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Count II should be DENIED.
C. Count III - Retaliation
Count III of Plaintiff's complaint brings a retaliation claim. (Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 82-96). The ADA makes it unlawful to "discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA] or because such individual made a charge...under [the ADA]." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). "To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under [the ADA], an employee must demonstrate (1) that she engaged in statutorily protected conduct, (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that a causal connection exists between the two." Batson, 897 F.3d at 1329. After the prima facie case of retaliation, the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework applies. See id.
Defendant does not dispute, for purposes of its motion, that Plaintiff engaged in protected conduct. (Doc. 55-2 at 15). Rather, it argues under the second prong that Plaintiff was "fully accommodated, yet resigned from her employment," meaning that it "did not take any adverse employment action against Cherry whatsoever." Id. at 15-16. Defendant does not address the "causal connection" prong. Plaintiff [*37]  argues that there was an adverse action—she was fired. (Doc. 58 at 24-25). For the reasons that summary judgment is not appropriate on the "adverse employment action" prong of Count I, it is inappropriate as to Count III as well. There is a material factual dispute about whether Plaintiff resigned or was fired, and Defendant's motion as to Count III, premised on the fact of resignation, should be DENIED.

IV. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
For the reasons discussed above, IT IS RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 55), be DENIED.
This is a Final Report and Recommendation, and there is nothing further in this action pending before the undersigned. Accordingly, the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference of this matter to the undersigned.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED this 23rd day of July, 2019.
