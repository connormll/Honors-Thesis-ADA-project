ORDER ON MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [#237]
This Order addresses Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment ("Motion") pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. [#237.]1 The Parties stipulated to the jurisdiction of the Magistrate Judge. [#44.] The Court has reviewed the Motion, the Response, and the Reply, including the exhibits attached to those filings. [#256; #264.]. The Court also held oral argument on the Motion on April 16, 2019, and ordered supplemental briefs on the Eighth Amendment claim. [#270.] The parties submitted their respective supplemental briefs on May 14 and 28, 2019, which the Court has reviewed. [#273; #278.] Now, being fully informed by the filings, the parties' oral arguments, and the Court's review of applicable law, the Court GRANTS the Motion for the [*2]  reasons explained below.

A. BACKGROUND FACTS
The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. The following facts are undisputed for purposes of deciding the Motion:
Plaintiff, Jason Brooks ("Brooks"), is an inmate serving a 32-year sentence for securities fraud. [#237 at ¶1.] He started his incarceration with the Colorado Department of Corrections (CDOC) on May 3, 2010. [Id. at ¶5.] He was initially placed in Bent County Correctional Facility, a private prison operated by Core Civic, where he resided from May 20, 2010, to February 14, 2012. [Id. at ¶6.] He was placed in Fremont Correctional Facility ("Fremont") on February 14, 2012, where he resided until April 23, 2018. [Id. at ¶7.] Finally, he was placed in Sterling Correctional Facility ("Sterling") on April 23, 2018, where he has remained so far. [Id. at ¶8.] This action involves Defendants' conduct while Brooks resided at Fremont. [See generally the Second Amended Complaint at #68.]
Brooks was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis in 2002; his condition was not managed well prior to his incarceration. [Id. at ¶9.] The symptoms of ulcerative colitis vary over time and from person to person; symptoms can include "rectal bleeding, abdominal [*3]  pain, and diarrhea." [Id. at ¶10.] Brooks historically experienced "multiple, urgent, loose, watery and often bloody bowel movements per day, associated with a significant amount of abdominal discomfort." [Id. at ¶11.] Ultimately, ulcerative colitis cannot be cured with medications; treatment is designed to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. [Id. at ¶12.]
Brooks can function reasonably if treatment limits the amount his intestines bleed and manages his abdominal pain. [Id. at ¶13.] When he arrived at Fremont in 2012, the CDOC medical providers worked with CDOC dietitians and a gastroenterologist to mitigate his symptoms. [Id. at ¶14.] CDOC staff achieved the best management of Brooks' condition he has ever experienced. [Id.] In fact, Brooks has experienced a "night and day" difference since Dr. Creany started managing his condition in 2012. [Id. at ¶15.] Brooks is now being treated with Humira, which has effectively mitigated his symptoms, by stopping his bleeding and lessening all symptom severity, since August 2012. [Id. at ¶16.]
Now that Brooks' pain has subsided with CDOC's treatment, however, he still experiences incontinence as a result of his medical condition. Brooks [*4]  explains that now that his pain is significantly controlled, it has become more difficult for him "to catch the urgency, as far as like being able to know when it's going to come," and "to catch when there's going to be an incontinence issue or soiling until it actually happens," in which case he has to clean himself up. [Id. at ¶19.] As a result, his incontinence results in unanticipated and unpredictable soiling. [#237-8 at ¶¶4, 8-9, 27; see also #237-1 at ¶201.]
In 2012 a Health Services Administrator from the CDOC wrote a medical certificate for Brooks that allowed him to attend med-line and meals with the first chow pull for a three-month period ending June 5, 2012.2 [#237 at ¶22; #237-9.] During that three-month period, when Brooks received his medications from the med-line, he would go to the med-line first to obtain his medications and then proceed to the cafeteria for his meals; after the end of the three-month period, he no longer needed to go to the med-line for his medication. [#237 at ¶23.] Although his medical certificate—which allowed him to attend the med-line—expired in June 2012, certain facility staff still allowed Brooks to leave for the cafeteria with the first chow [*5]  pull, until that staff was replaced. [Id. at ¶24.]
Brooks made various accommodation requests in 2012. [Id. at ¶¶25-33.] On February 6, 2012, he was told in a memo that incontinence supplies, or undergarments, were an appropriate way to address his incontinence, in addition to regular or frequent restroom access. [Id. at ¶30]. He was also told that "frequent bathroom breaks are not always possible due to security and accountability reasons," and incontinence supplies would accommodate his digestive concerns "during those times." [Id. at ¶31.] Brooks subsequently requested to be placed at an "ADA designated facility" based on his medical condition. [Id.]
On May 28, 2013, Brooks requested a "pass that allows me to go with the first pulls to medline and chow so I can deal with fecal incontinence issues." [Id. at ¶36; #237-2 p.49.] On June 11, 2013, Defendant Julie Russell ("Russell") denied the request citing "medical issue" as the reason, and further explained, "[y]ou may request early med line pass and adult undergarments from Clinical services as part of your medical treatment plans." [#237-2 at p.52.] Russell was a non-medical prison official who was an ADA Inmate Coordinator (AIC) [*6]  Designee from 2008 to 2015. [#237 at ¶2.] She was responsible for providing accommodations to prisoners with disabilities to afford them meaningful access to CDOC programs and services. [Id. at ¶45.] She responded only to Brooks' requests for a med-line and meal pass, and extra toilet paper; any other requests were assigned to different AIC Designees. [Id. at ¶50.]
The meal pass was not medically indicated, but rather, it was an accommodation Brooks sought to allow him an additional option for accessing the chow hall around any flare-ups in his condition. [#256 at p.7 ("Nothing involved in the responsibilities to ensure Plaintiff could physically access the chow hall without extreme difficulty has anything to do with Plaintiff's medical case."); #239 at ¶238 ("Plaintiff's ability to access the chow hall (i.e. food service) is a program, service, and activity provided by the CDOC...and has nothing to do with Plaintiff's medical treatment."); #237-6 at ¶17 ("A pass allowing Plaintiff to leave for the chow hall with the first pull was not required for treatment of Plaintiff's ulcerative colitis."); see generally the discussion at oral argument at #270.]. The meal pass Brooks sought as [*7]  an accommodation would not have ensured he could access all of his meals. [#237-13 at p.1.]
Ultimately, Brooks refused to wear adult undergarments for purposes of accessing meals during his chow pull. [See generally #256.] Since arriving at Sterling in April 2018, the facility eventually issued Brooks a meal pass, which allows him to access his meals with the diabetic pull. [#270.] The diabetic pull occurs at the same time each day, at 6:20am, 12:00pm, and 5:00pm. [Id.] Because the meal times are set, Brooks can prepare his body around these set times such that his incontinence is less likely to interfere with his ability to access his meals. [Id.]
Procedurally, Brooks originally sued the CDOC and various of its employees, and the owner of a private prison and various of its employees. In his First Amended Complaint, Brooks asserted claims under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and a claim for violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which Magistrate Judge Craig B. Shaffer (who was then presiding over this case) granted in part and denied in part. In his partial dismissal order, Judge Shaffer dismissed Brooks' claims under the ADA and the [*8]  Fourteenth Amendment and the case proceeded with respect to the Eighth Amendment claims. Following a period of discovery, the remaining Defendants moved for summary judgment; Judge Shaffer entered summary judgment in favor of all Defendants on November 21, 2016. [ECF. #159.] After Brooks appealed to the Tenth Circuit, the appellate court affirmed in part, and reversed in part, and remanded the case for this Court's consideration of Brooks' ADA claim, and his Eighth Amendment claim against Russell only.
Thus, the dust having settled, the case is currently postured with (1) Brooks' claim under Title II of the ADA for failure to accommodate a disability (by providing him a special meal pass and extra toilet paper) against the CDOC, and Russell, Howell, and Tessiere in their official capacities; and, (2) his claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of the Eighth Amendment against Russell in her individual capacity.3

B. STANDARD OF REVIEW

1. Summary Judgment
The purpose of a summary judgment motion is to assess whether trial is necessary. White v. York Int'l Corp., 45 F.3d 357, 360 (10th Cir. 1995). Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A dispute is "genuine" if the issue could be resolved in favor of either party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); Farthing v. City of Shawnee, 39 F.3d 1131, 1135 (10th Cir. 1994). A fact [*9]  is "material" if it might reasonably affect the outcome of the case. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Farthing, 39 F.3d at 1134.
A party who does not have the burden of proof at trial must show the absence of a genuine issue of fact. Concrete Works of Colo., Inc. v. City & Cty. of Denver, 36 F.3d 1513, 1517 (10th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1004, 115 S. Ct. 1315, 131 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1995). Once the motion has been properly supported, the burden shifts to the nonmovant to show by depositions, affidavits, and other competent evidence that summary judgment is not proper. Concrete Works, 36 F.3d at 1518. All evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. Kidd v. Taos Ski Valley, Inc., 88 F.3d 848, 851 (10th Cir. 1996). However, conclusory statements and testimony based merely on conjecture or subjective belief are not competent summary judgment evidence. Rice v. United States, 166 F.3d 1088, 1092 (10th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 933, 120 S. Ct. 334, 145 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1999); Nutting v. RAM Southwest, Inc., 106 F. Supp.2d 1121, 1123 (D. Colo. 2000).
The Court acknowledges that Brooks is not an attorney. Consequently, his filings and related submissions are construed liberally and held to a less stringent standard than formal filings drafted by a lawyer. Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991) (citing Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S. Ct. 594, 30 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1972)). Despite the liberal construction afforded pro se pleadings, however, courts will not construct arguments or theories for a pro se party in the absence of any discussion of those issues. Dunn v. White, 880 F.2d 1188, 1197 (10th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1059, 110 S. Ct. 871, 107 L. Ed. 2d 954 (1990).

2. Qualified Immunity
Defendant Russell has raised the qualified immunity defense as to the Eighth Amendment claims asserted against her in her individual capacity. Qualified [*10]  immunity shields "government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known." Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565 (2009) (quotation omitted). Qualified immunity is "immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability [and] it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial." Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1985). Whether defendants are entitled to qualified immunity is a legal question. Wilder v. Turner, 490 F.3d 810, 813 (10th Cir. 2007).
When the qualified immunity defense is raised, the plaintiff bears the burden of showing, with particularity, facts and law establishing the inference that the defendant violated a clearly established federal constitutional or statutory right. Walter v. Morton, 33 F.3d 1240, 1242 (10th Cir. 1994). If the plaintiff fails to satisfy either prong, the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity. Pearson, 555 U.S. at 236. The Court has the discretion to consider these prongs in any order it chooses. Leverington v. City of Colorado Springs, 643 F.3d 719, 732 (10th Cir. 2011).
As to the first prong, "[i]f no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established," the inquiry is at an end. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S. Ct. 2151, 150 L. Ed. 2d 272 (2001). The second prong—whether the right was clearly established—must be considered "in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition." [*11]  Id. An official's conduct "violates clearly established law when, at the time of the challenged conduct, 'the contours of a right are sufficiently clear' that every 'reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing is violating that right.'" Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 741, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 179 L. Ed. 2d 1149 (2011) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S. Ct. 3034, 97 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1987)). To be clearly established, "existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate." Id.

C. ANALYSIS
Defendants move for summary judgment on the following grounds: (1) the Title II ADA claim fails on the second element of the prima facie case because Defendants reasonably accommodated Brooks' disability; (2) the Eleventh Amendment precludes Brooks' damage claims; (3) Brooks' claims for injunctive relief under Title II are moot; (4) there is an absence of evidence that Russell possessed the requisite mental state to maintain the Eighth Amendment claim; and (5) Russell is entitled to qualified immunity on the Eighth Amendment claim.

1. TITLE II OF THE ADA
Brooks asserts his Title II claim against the CDOC, and Howell, Russell, and Tessier in their official capacities.4 Under Title II of the ADA, it is illegal to discriminate in government programs, activities, and services against a qualified individual with a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12132 [*12] . This provision of the ADA applies to state prisons. Penn. Dep't of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 210, 118 S. Ct. 1952, 141 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1998) ("[s]tate prisons fall squarely within the statutory definition of 'public entity'"); see also Robertson v. Las Animas Cty. Sheriff's Dep't, 500 F.3d 1185, 1193 (10th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted).
The ADA protects qualified individuals with disabilities "who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices...meet[] the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12131. The law places an affirmative obligation on public entities to reasonably accommodate qualified individuals with disabilities to allow them to participate in its programs and services. See generally 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).
To establish a Title II violation under a reasonable accommodation theory, a plaintiff must show: (1) he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) he is unable, because of his disability, to meaningfully access a public benefit to which he is entitled; and (3) the public entity failed, despite his request, to provide a reasonable accommodation for his disability. Todd v. Carstarphen, 236 F. Supp.3d 1311, 1327 (N.D. Ga. 2017). A claim for failure to make a reasonable accommodation does not require a showing of discriminatory motive. Id. at 1328. Nor is a plaintiff required to show a complete deprivation of access to a program or service without a reasonable accommodation. Shotz v. Cates, 256 F.3d 1077, 1080 (11th Cir. 2001).

a. Mootness [*13]  of Injunctive-Relief Based on Brooks' Transfer from Fremont
Because Brooks no longer resides at Fremont where his claims arose, the Court must consider whether his transfer to Sterling moots the injunctive relief he seeks under his Title II claim. Federal courts may only consider actual cases or controversies. Kan. Judicial Review v. Stout, 562 F.3d 1240, 1245 (10th Cir. 2009) ("Article III delimits the jurisdiction of federal courts, allowing us to consider only actual cases or controversies.") An actual controversy must exist through all stages of the case. Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 67, 117 S. Ct. 1055, 137 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1997). It is not sufficient for the actual controversy to exist only at the time the complaint is filed. Id. An actual controversy which ceases to exist at any stage of the case raises the question of constitutional mootness.
"When a prisoner files suit against prison officials who work in the institution in which he is incarcerated, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the basis of alleged wrongful conduct by those officials, and then that prisoner is subsequently transferred to another prison...," courts must consider whether mootness applies. Jordan v. Sosa, 654 F.3d 1012, 1027 (10th Cir. 2011). "Where the prisoner's claims for declaratory or injunctive relief relate solely to the conditions of confinement at the penal institution at which [*14]  the prisoner is no longer incarcerated, courts have concluded that they are unable to provide the prisoner with effective relief." Id. Thus, courts routinely dismiss "penitentiary-specific conditions-of-confinement claims as moot" because the prisoner's transfer suggests the end of the alleged deprivation of his constitutional rights. Id.
The mootness issue differs, however, when a transferred prisoner's lawsuit challenges policies that apply uniformly throughout the prison system. Jordan, 654 F.3d at 1028; Abdulhaseeb v. Calbone, 600 F.3d 1301, 1312 (10th Cir. 2010). In this instance, a transferred prisoner's claims for injunctive relief typically are not considered moot because the prisoner sues "defendants who were actually situated to effectuate any prospective relief that the courts might see fit to grant—viz., that the prisoners had sued the director of the prison system or the prison system itself."5 Jordan, 654 F.3d at 1028. Ultimately, in "deciding whether a case is moot, the crucial question is whether granting a present determination of the issues offered will have some effect in the real world. When it becomes impossible for a court to grant effective relief, a live controversy ceases to exist, and the case becomes moot." Kan. Judicial Review, 562 F.3d at 1246 (citation and quotation omitted).
Brooks sued each Defendant [*15]  for injunctive relief in their official capacities. Based on the procedural history of this case, the ADA claim has been narrowed to Brooks' request for a special meal pass and extra toilet paper as reasonable accommodations to his disability, specifically his incontinence.
Brooks made various accommodation requests in 2012. [#237 at ¶¶25-33 (admitted in #256).] On May 28, 2013, he requested a "pass that allows me to go with the first pulls to medline and chow so I can deal with fecal incontinence issues." [#237 at ¶36; #237-2 at p.49.] On June 11, 2013, Russell denied the request citing "medical issue" as the reason, and further explaining "[y]ou may request early med line pass and adult undergarments from Clinical services as part of your medical treatment plans." [#237-2 at p.52.] Russell was a non-medical prison official who was an ADA Inmate Coordinator (AIC) Designee from 2008 to 2015. [#237 at ¶2.] She was responsible for providing accommodations to prisoners with disabilities to afford them meaningful access to CDOC programs and services. [Id. at ¶45.] She responded only to Brooks' requests for a med-line and meal pass, and extra toilet paper; any other requests were assigned [*16]  to different AIC Designees. [Id. at ¶50.]
The Court finds it undisputed that Brooks' requests for a special meal pass and extra toilet paper (and any other accommodations he requested) were specific to the conditions of his confinement at Fremont. [See generally the Second Amended Complaint at #68.] For example, in the Second Amended Complaint, Brooks alleged that Russell,
...knew that Plaintiff was having problems even getting extra toilet paper, but refused to accommodate. [Russell] knows that Plaintiffs disability could be better managed at Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility or Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility, as having Plaintiff move would be considered a reasonable accommodation, yet deliberately, maliciously, and wantonly denied every accommodation request Plaintiff has ever applied for...
[#68-1 at p.22; see also id. at p.29 §B (emphasis added).]
Similarly, with regards to Defendants Howell and Tessiere, Brooks alleges that,
[t]hese defendant's fully understood the plaintiffs medical condition and knew he was suffering being housed at the [Fremont]. They knew keeping the plaintiff housed at the [Fremont] would cause adverse medical consequences and willfully chose to disregard [*17]  the plaintiffs complaints and the risk posed to his health and safety, knowing other facilities would be more compatible to accommodate his serious medical needs.
[#68-1 at p.23 (emphasis added).] Further, the Second Amended Complaint names Tessiere as a defendant in his official capacity as the Health Service Administrator of Fremont, where Tessiere was responsible for oversight and management of that facility's Clinical Services Department. [#68 at p.6, ¶15.] It further alleges that Tessiere was one of the "only staff members at the [Fremont] able to authorize a pass to be written for extra toilet paper." [Id. at p.32, ¶129.]
To the extent Brooks' ADA claim is premised upon a special meal pass to allow him to take his meals with the first chow pull and to allow him extra toilet paper at Fremont, his subsequent transfer to Sterling mooted his claim. Jordan, 654 F.3d at 1027-28 (prisoner claims for injunctive relief that relate solely to conditions existing at a specific facility are mooted by prisoner's subsequent transfer to another facility).
To be sure, however, Brooks also asserts his ADA claim against the CDOC, Russell in her official capacity as the ADA Inmate Coordinator, and Howell in her official capacity as the [*18]  Regional Director of Corrections and Clinical Services—perhaps suggesting a system-wide (as opposed to facility-specific) challenge over the accommodations of a special meal pass and extra toilet paper. See Abdulhaseeb, 600 F.3d at 1312. But even considering a system-wide claim for injunctive relief, it is undisputed that Brooks is now allowed to take his meals with the diabetic pull at Sterling—which is the meal pass he sought either all along or at least once he transferred to that facility. [#256 at p.8 ("The Defendants are allowing Brooks an ability to walk around the correctional facility...to try and get his meals every single day with the diabetic pull—which is exactly what Brooks has requested for years, as there is a diabetic pull at every CDOC facility...") (emphasis added).]
Because Brooks has now received the relief he sought by way of this lawsuit in terms of the meal pass, his ADA claim is mooted by his receipt of that relief. See Ind v. Colo. Dep't of Corr., 801 F.3d 1209, 1211, 1217 (10th Cir. 2015) (prisoner's transfer from administrative segregation into general population rendered claims moot where he was no longer subjected to the restrictions which gave rise to his suit); Morris v. Cozza-Rhodes, No. 15-cv-01877-RM, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150928, 2015 WL 6811422, at *2 (D. Colo. Nov. 6, 2015) ("...Plaintiff is not being transferred to ADX Florence [*19]  and has received the relief he seeks."); Burden v. Olen, No. 06-cv-00268-ZLW-MEH, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56329, 2007 WL 2244794 (D. Colo. Aug. 2, 2007) (plaintiff's claim seeking a change in his sex offender classification was moot where his sex offender status was changed); Yellowbear v. Hargett, No. 15-cv-213-J, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193318, 2016 WL 10520959, at *10 (D. Wyo. Dec. 19, 2016) ("Declaratory or injunctive relief would accomplish nothing going forward. Plaintiff wanted a particular book. ...Plaintiff got the book he sought. ...Plaintiff's claim on this issue is thus basically moot.")
It is similarly undisputed that Brooks now possess a pass that allows him to receive three extra rolls of toilet paper. [#237-8 at p.17 ("And now I've got a little piece of paper, so anytime I need an extra roll of toilet paper, I give them the piece of paper that says I'm allowed to have three extra rolls... .").] His ADA claim, which seeks injunctive relief to require defendants to provide him additional rolls of toilet paper, therefore, is also moot. See Ind, 801 F.3d at 1211, 1217; Morris, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150928, 2015 WL 6811422, at *2; Burden, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56329, 2007 WL 2244794, at *3; Yellowbear, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193318, 2016 WL 10520959, at *10.
For these reasons, Brooks ADA claim is moot to the extent it seeks injunctive relief, and summary judgment is warranted on that aspect of his relief.6
b. Eleventh Amendment Immunity Re: Damages Sought under Title II Claim
It is well-settled that Congress revoked the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity from [*20]  claims for injunctive relief under Title II of the ADA. United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 160, 126 S. Ct. 877, 163 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2006). It has also revoked the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity from damage claims by state prisoners that allege violations of both Title II of the ADA and the U.S. Constitution. Id. at 155-60; Cf. Ray v. Dep't of Corr., No. CIV-14-735-C, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41184, 2016 WL 1212773, at *10 (W.D. Okla. Mar. 2, 2016) (Eleventh Amendment immunity applied to prisoner's Title II damage claim where he failed to allege an actual violation of the Eighth Amendment).
The Supreme Court established a three-step analysis for evaluating Eleventh Amendment immunity in the context of a state prisoner's Title II claim, which is to:
determine in the first instance, on a claim-by-claim basis, (1) which aspects of the State's alleged conduct violated Title II; (2) to what extent such misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated Title II but did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether Congress's purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid.
Georgia, 546 U.S. at 159; see also Guttman v. Khalsa, 669 F.3d 1101, 1112-13 (10th Cir. 2012). Thus, in order to determine whether the Eleventh Amendment precludes Brooks' monetary damage claims under Title II, the Court must first determine whether there are any disputed issues of fact over whether Defendants' conduct violated Title II.
"The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should [*21]  be whether entities covered under the ADA have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred..." 28 C.F.R. § 35.101(b). The ADA's implementing regulations apply to "all services, programs, and activities provided or made available by public entities." Id. at § 35.102(a); see also id. at § 42.540(h) (defining "program or activity" to mean "all of the operations" of a covered entity"). It defines "benefit" to include "provision of services, financial aid, or disposition (i.e., handling, decision, sentencing, confinement, or other prescription of conduct)." Id. at § 42.540(j). Thus, the Court finds that CDOC's meal service is a program or service within the meaning of Title II of the ADA.
A reasonable accommodation must provide a plaintiff with "meaningful access" to the program or service. Cf. Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301, 105 S. Ct. 712, 83 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1985). Only accommodations that impose undue financial and administrative burdens or require a fundamental alteration in a program or service are deemed unreasonable. Southeastern Cmty. Coll. v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 412, 99 S. Ct. 2361, 60 L. Ed. 2d 980 (1979) (regarding undue burden); Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 275, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307 (1987) (regarding fundamental alteration). Further, a qualified individual with a disability is not entitled to the accommodation of their choice or the best possible accommodation. See Smith v. Midland Brake, Inc., 180 F.3d 1154, 1177 (10th Cir. 1999) (regarding accommodation of choice); Mason v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., 559 F.3d 880, 887-88 (8th Cir. 2009) (prison not required [*22]  to provide materials in Braille to blind prisoner where accommodations it did provide allowed meaningful access to programs).
To establish a Title II violation under a reasonable accommodation theory, Brooks must show: (1) he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) he is unable, because of his disability, to meaningfully access a public benefit to which he is entitled; and (3) the public entity failed, despite his request, to provide a reasonable accommodation for his disability. Todd v. Carstarphen, 236 F. Supp. 3d 1311, 1327 (N.D. Ga. 2017). A plaintiff is not required to show a discriminatory motive under a reasonable accommodation claim. Id. at 1328. Nor is a plaintiff required to show a complete deprivation of access to a program or service without a reasonable accommodation. Shotz v. Cates, 256 F.3d 1077, 1080 (11th Cir. 2001).
Here, it is undisputed that Brooks is a qualified individual with a disability based on his ulcerative colitis. [#264 at p.12.] It is further undisputed that the CDOC's provision of meals to its inmate population is a "program or service" within the meaning of Title II of the ADA. [#237-2 at p.24 (Administrative Regulation 750-04, effective 01/01/12, defining services and programs to include "food service").]; see also Gorman v. Bartch, 152 F.3d 907, 913 (8th Cir. 1998) ("The statute[] must be interpreted broadly to include [*23]  the ordinary operations of a public entity in order to carry out the purpose of prohibiting discrimination."). And Defendants appear to concede the second element of the prima facie case, that being that Brooks is unable to meaningfully access his meals because of his disability. [See generally #237]. Thus, the thrust of the Court's inquiry is on the third element—whether the undisputed facts show that Defendants failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for his disability despite his requests.
Key to this inquiry is the settled concept under the law that a prisoner is not entitled to the best possible accommodation, but rather, only a reasonable accommodation which allows for meaningful access to the program or service. See Mason, 559 F.3d at 887-88 (prison not required to provide materials in Braille to blind prisoner where accommodations it did provide allowed meaningful access to programs); see also Tenn. v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 531-32, 124 S. Ct. 1978, 158 L. Ed. 2d 820 (2004) ("Title II does not require States to employ any and all means to make judicial services accessible to persons with disabilities," rather, Title II "requires only 'reasonable modifications' that would not fundamentally alter the nature of the service provided....""); Tucker v. Tenn., 539 F.3d 526, 533 (6th Cir. 2008) (an accommodation is not a violation [*24]  of ADA even if "not ideal" so long as it is reasonable and effective); Burkhart v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 112 F.3d 1207, 1213, 324 U.S. App. D.C. 241 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (although consideration should be given to the individual's choice, "[n]othing in the ADA itself or its implementing regulations dictates that a disabled individual must be provided with the type of auxiliary aid or service he requests" and that deference to the requests is "by no means required"); Petersen by & Through Petersen v. Hastings Pub. Sch., 31 F.3d 705, 708-09 (8th Cir. 1994) (auxiliary aids need not be those chosen by individual if they are effective).
This concept in the prison-setting is consistent with the application of the ADA in the employment-setting, where an employer is not required to provide an employee with the accommodation of their choice. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(d) ("the employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations, and may choose the less expensive accommodation or the accommodation that is easier for it to provide."); see also Smith, 180 F.3d at 1177 (employer is free to choose the reasonable accommodation); Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285-86 (11th Cir. 1997) ("Stated plainly, under the ADA a qualified individual with a disability is not entitled to the accommodation of her choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation.") (internal quotations and citations omitted); Gile v. United Airlines Inc., 95 F.3d 492, 499 (7th Cir. 1996) ("An employer is not obligated to provide [*25]  an employee the accommodation he requests or prefers, the employer need only provide some reasonable accommodation.").
The Court is further guided by the "view that meaningful access and the question of whether accommodations are reasonable must be assessed through the prism of the prison setting." Havens v. Colo. Dep't of Corr., 897 F.3d 1250, 1270 (10th Cir. 2018) (citing Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84-85, 107 S. Ct. 2254, 96 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1987)). "Prison officials have the obligation to consider security and other factors unique to the prison environment in their decision-making, and courts have accorded them considerable discretion to do so." Id. (citing Onishea v. Hopper, 171 F.3d 1289, 1300 (11th Cir. 1999)); see Wells v. Thaler, 460 F. App'x 303, 313 (5th Cir. 2012) ("Additionally, our conclusion that the provided auxiliary aids and services are sufficient is informed by the context of this suit—a correctional facility—and we accord the officials at the Estelle Unit deference in their determination of an appropriate accommodation.").
Here, the "benefit" Brooks sought while residing at Fremont was meaningful access to the chow hall or meals provided by the CDOC. [#256 at pp.7, 8, 19, 28, 52.] He argues that the incontinence and pain associated with his disability prevented him from regularly accessing the chow hall at the prescribed time for his unit, and therefore, he was "forced to miss hundreds of meals." [#68-1 at Claim Five; [*26]  see also #256 at p.21 ("While Defendants fruitlessly argue that adult undergarments are a reasonable 'tool' use (sic) to manage incontinence, such 'accommodation' only mitigates a single effect of Plaintiff's disability and does not provide 'meaningful access' to the chow hall."] He claims that a special meal pass that would give him the flexibility to choose to obtain his meals during either the first or second chow pulls would have provided him meaningful access to meals while at that facility.7 [#256 at pp.52, see also pp.7, 8, 19.]
Defendants contend that their provision of adult undergarments to Brooks was a reasonable accommodation to allow him meaningful access to his meals. They argue that
Mr. Brooks was offered an accommodation which allows him to access the cafeteria during meal service, regardless of the unpredictability of his underlying medical condition involving incontinence, and that accommodation is adult undergarments. This accommodation is a reasonable means of providing Mr. Brooks with meaningful access to obtain meals while incarcerated and therefore defeats Mr. Brooks' discrimination claim.
[#264 p.2.] They further argue that the request for a meal pass is Brooks' [*27]  accommodation of choice, which they claim he is not entitled to receive. [#264, Section I.]
The Court finds there are no disputed issues of material fact—the undisputed evidence shows that Defendants satisfied their Title II obligations by offering a reasonable accommodation that Brooks refused, and therefore, Brooks cannot establish the third element of his prima facie case. There is no dispute that once Brooks arrived at Fremont in 2012, CDOC medical providers worked with dietitians and a gastroenterologist to mitigate his symptoms. [#237 at ¶14.] Brooks admits that CDOC staff achieved the best management of his condition he has ever experienced, and that since August 2012, his treatment with Humira has effectively mitigated his symptoms by stopping his bleeding and lessening all symptom severity. [Id. at ¶¶14-16.] But despite his improvement, Brooks continued to miss numerous chow pulls because of his incontinence. In response to his various requests for an accommodation of his incontinence to allow him to access his meals at times other than his regular chow pull, Defendants offered Brooks adult undergarments. Brooks refused the accommodation. [See generally #256.]
The Court finds [*28]  that Defendants' provision of adult undergarments to address Brooks incontinence, though not ideal, is a reasonable accommodation that would provide him meaningful access to his meals. Incontinence is defined as: "inability of the body to control the evacuative functions of urination or defecation : partial or complete loss of bladder or bowel control." Merriam-Webster online dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/incontinence (last accessed 09/27/19). Inherent to the condition is the inability to control bladder or bowel functions, which Brooks has acknowledged. [#237-8 at pp.25-27.] Given this aspect of the condition, a different meal pass would not meaningfully or reasonably accommodate Brooks' condition because, ultimately, he cannot control his bladder/bowel functions.
More to the point, Brooks conceded in his deposition that undergarments are reasonable if an individual has an inability to control their bowels, and he acknowledged that he is unable to control his bowels despite his efforts to hold them:
Q. (By Mr. Vanlandschoot): You testified before that you knew a couple of guys that used undergarments.
A. (By Mr. Brooks): Yeah.
Q. Explain to me why it's okay for [*29]  them but not for you.
A. Oh, there's not really a rationale of being okay or not okay. There is a rationale of being reasonable or unreasonable, and in all situations it's completely unreasonable, unless you have an inability to control your bowels. ...
Q. So that gets back to sort of the interchangeable nature of the way that you use incontinence, because incontinence — my understanding is that you are incapable of controlling, whether it's your bowels or your urine.
A. Yeah.
Q. And so it sounds to me like what you are testifying to today is you're not incontinent, however, there are some circumstances when you have held your bowels for so long that you cannot stop or you cannot affect the leakage.
A. Yeah, that's both true. But right now, I can't even tell when the leakage is about to start. So that is not up to me. I can't even — without that pain response, without even knowing that. That's the difficulty now. So I can't tell. I know, if I use the restroom, that probably is a good indicator that it's not going to happen. It doesn't mean it's not going to happen entirely.
[#237-8 at pp.25-27 (emphasis added).] Brooks concedes three things with this testimony: (1) undergarments are reasonable [*30]  if "you have an inability to control your bowels;" (2) he has an inability to control his bowels (whether or not he calls it "incontinence" [#68-1 at Claim Five]); and, (3) because he has an inability to control his bowels, undergarments are a reasonable accommodation.
As a result, Brooks has failed to raise a disputed issue of material fact on his Title II ADA claim.8 The undisputed facts show that Defendants provided Brooks a reasonable accommodation to his incontinence that would allow him meaningful access to the chow hall. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim. Also, because the Court has determined the undisputed facts do not support finding that Defendants violated Title II, the Eleventh Amendment precludes Brooks' claim for monetary damages. See Georgia, 546 U.S. at 159.

2. EIGHTH AMENDMENT CLAIM
When an incarcerated plaintiff challenges the conditions of confinement under the Eighth Amendment, the plaintiff must sufficiently allege deliberate indifference (the subjective test) to a substantial risk of serious harm (the objective test). See Perkins v. Kan. Dep't of Corrs., 165 F.3d 803, 807 (10th Cir. 1999); see also Tennant v. Miller, 589 F. App'x 884, 885-86 (10th Cir. 2014). Particularly, a plaintiff must allege deprivation of a basic human need, such as "food, warmth or exercise." See Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 304-05, 111 S. Ct. 2321, 115 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1991). Conditions that are merely "harsh" or "restrictive" are merely [*31]  "part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society." Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347, 101 S. Ct. 2392, 69 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1981). Thus, to establish a conditions-of-confinement claim, the deprivation must be extreme.9 Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 9, 112 S. Ct. 995, 117 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1992).
The subjective component asks whether the prison official acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind. Wilson, 501 U.S. at 298. This follows from the principle that "'only the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain implicates the Eighth Amendment.'" Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994) (quoting Wilson, 501 U.S. at 297). The "deliberate indifference" subjective standard applies to claims of inhumane conditions of confinement. Wilson, 501 U.S. at 303-04. A finding of deliberate indifference requires a showing that the defendant "knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety." Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837. Under this standard, "the official must both be aware of the facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference." Id.
Brooks contends that in denying his request for a special meal pass, Russell was deliberately indifferent (subjective component) to a substantial risk of serious harm (objective component), namely his missing a significant number of meals. This claim fails for several reasons.
First, the claim fails on the objective component because [*32]  the undisputed facts do not demonstrate that Russell's failure to issue Brooks a meal pass deprived him access to his meals. While meals and the ability to obtain them is a basic human need, the undisputed facts do not demonstrate that Russell has done anything to deprive Brooks of that need. Instead, Brooks' argument is that Russell deprived him of a special meal pass to allow him to choose between different chow pulls based on his incontinence. All along, he was called to his usual chow pull each day, but on numerous occasions, he chose not to go with his chow pull due to his medical condition. As discussed above, Defendants accommodated Brooks' pain to the point that it was well-managed, and they offered him adult undergarments—which he has refused—as an accommodation to allow him to go with his regular chow pull to obtain his meals. See Freeman v. Berge, 441 F.3d 543, 547 (7th Cir. 2006) (no Eighth Amendment violation where "to an overwhelming degree [the inmate's] food deprivation was self-inflicted"). Thus, there is no evidence Russell deprived Brooks of his meals, or access to them. Instead, she denied Brooks a special meal pass that was not medically indicated. Under these facts, no reasonable juror could conclude that the objective standard [*33]  is met because the record does not support a finding of a deprivation of basic human need by Russell. See Ajaj v. U.S., 293 F. App'x 575, 583 (10th Cir. 2008) (a deprivation of human need must exist for the overall conditions of confinement to rise to the level of cruel and unusual punishment); Gambina v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, No. 10-CV-02376-MSK-KLM, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28766, 2013 WL 791428, at *6 (D. Colo. Mar. 4, 2013) (granting summary judgment where plaintiff failed to show deprivation of a basic human need), aff'd, 529 F. App'x 900 (10th Cir. 2013); see also Freeman v. Colo. Dep't of Corr., No. 16-cv-02151-MJW, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104435, 2018 WL 3093327, *5 (D. Colo. June 22, 2018) ("missing sporadic lunch meals does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation"); Nance v. Schwartz, No. 09-cv-097-DRH, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68354, 2009 WL 2413835, at *1 (S.D. Ill. Aug. 5, 2009) (Eighth Amendment claim failed on the objective component where prisoner alleged his access to water was merely impeded rather than that he was completely deprived of water). In this regard, Brooks' circumstances are distinguishable from the line of cases involving Eighth Amendment claims over actual deprivations of food by prison officials. See Green v. Johnson, 977 F.2d 1383, 1391 (10th Cir. 1992) (defendant ordered a 72-hour reduction in rations); Dearman v. Woodson, 429 F.2d 1288, 1290 (10th Cir. 1970) (defendants refused to provide plaintiff with food for two days).
Second, the Court held oral argument on April 16, 2019, to address the Eighth Amendment claim, and specifically, whether the meal pass Brooks requested was medically indicated. In reviewing [*34]  the original briefing on this matter, the Court observed that the parties briefed the issue of deliberate indifference to a serious medical need at length, however, there was no indication in the record that the meal pass was medically indicated. If not medically indicated, then the Eighth Amendment claim is more properly analyzed as an issue of conditions of confinement, as opposed to one of deliberate indifference to a serious medical need. Cf. Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559, 575 (10th Cir. 1980) (for purposes of establishing a violation of the Eighth Amendment, a medical need is serious if it is one that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment); Byrd v. Wilson, 701 F.2d 592, 594-95 (6th Cir. 1983) (prison officials' deliberate indifference towards inmate's special diet can form basis for Eighth Amendment claim if diet is medically necessary).
During oral argument and in their supplemental briefs, the parties affirmed the Court's understanding that the meal pass Brooks requested was not medically indicated. This undisputed fact is fatal to Brooks' Eighth Amendment claim because the denial of care that is not medically indicated is not an Eighth Amendment violation. See Bailey v. Livingston, No. G-07-336, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63950, 2009 WL 2242352, at *9 (S.D. Tex. July 23, 2009) ("Plaintiff's medical records reflect that medical personnel were responsive to his complaint of loss of bowel control and they did not authorize [*35]  the diapers, blanket, or donut that plaintiff requested because they were not medically indicated. Plaintiff's dissatisfaction with the medical treatment he received does not mean that he suffered deliberate indifference."); Santiago v. Doom, No. 3:10-cv-039-H, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66089, 2011 WL 2471539, at *3 (W.D. Ky. June 21, 2011) ("[D]enial of medically unnecessary care cannot serve as the basis for an Eighth Amendment violation. The Court will dismiss this part of Plaintiff's Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment claim.")
For these reasons, the Court finds that based on the undisputed facts, no reasonable jury could conclude that Russell's denial of a special meal pass rose to the level of a substantial risk of serious harm. Accordingly, the Court finds that Brooks has failed to present sufficient evidence to establish the objective component of his Eighth Amendment claim. It is therefore unnecessary for the Court to address the subjective component. The Court finds there is no genuine dispute of material fact as to Brooks claim of cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. It further concludes that Russell is entitled to qualified immunity and that judgment must be entered in her favor as a matter of law.

CONCLUSION
