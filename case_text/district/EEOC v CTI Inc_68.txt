ORDER
Pending before the Court are Defendant's Motions for Summary Judgment: Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 117) and Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's Claim for Punitive Damages. (Doc. 118.)
Plaintiff is the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and Defendant is CTI, a privately owned Arizona corporation in the business of transportation by truck of bulk commodities, including cement, lime, flyash and copper concentrate. CTI is subject to regulation by the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 (MCSA) and the federal/state Departments of Transportation (DOT).

SUMMARY
On September 30, 2013, the EEOC sued [*2]  CTI. The EEOC asserts (1) failure to accommodate claims on behalf of Barr, Pruett, Wolfe, Edmonds, Dittmer, and Wielgus, 42 U.S.C. §§12112(a) and (b)(5)(A); (2) discriminatory termination claims on behalf of Barr, Pruett, and Wolfe, 42 U.S.C. §§12112(a) and (b)(5)(B); and (3) maintenance and application of policies violative of Sections 102(b)(3) and 102(b)(6) of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to Barr, Pruett, Wolfe, Edmonds, Dittmer, and Wielgus. The EEOC seeks a permanent injunction from violations, a court order requiring implementation of various policies and procedures, compensatory relief for named individuals, and punitive damages. The EEOC requests a jury trial to resolve this action.
The EEOC has amassed a huge record that suggests circumstantially that the Defendant has violated the ADA when it comes to employees who have a recognized disability. Defendant in effect stipulates that each employee in question has a recognized disability under the ADA, the first element of an ADA claim. The dispute here is over whether or not the EEOC has produced direct or circumstantial evidence creating a material question of fact going to the second element of the ADA claim (with the burden on the EEOC) to prove that each plaintiff was a qualified individual under [*3]  the ADA. The term qualified individual means an individual with a disability who, with or without a reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. The individual must satisfy the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment position. 42 U.S.C. §12112; 29 C.F.R. §1630.2(m); Smith v. Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist., 727 F.3d 950, 956 (9th Cir. 2013). If this dispute is resolved in favor of the Plaintiff, then the next question to be resolved is the issue of punitive damages.1

HISTORICAL FACTUAL BACKGROUND
During the relevant time period, CTI had a policy of mailing letters informing employees on medical leaves that they might be, had been, or would be terminated if they could not return to "full, unrestricted duty" at the end of their leave and of terminating employees who could not return without restrictions. (PSF2 1-6, 8-12, 14). Kathleen Moriarty (Moriarty), CTI's human resources manager from early 2008 to August 2009, developed this policy and practice with approval from both Tom Jones (Jones) and CTI's owner, Greg Gibbons (Gibbons). (PSF 1-4, 14-16, 305, 308, 317-18). None of the letters mentioned reasonable accommodations, the ADA, or the possibility that an employee [*4]  could return to work with a restriction (even one that did not affect her ability to do her job). (PSF 7-9, 359-60). Ultimately, CTI fired employees like Barr, Pruett, and Wolfe who could not return to full, unrestricted duty at the end of their leave. (PSF 12-13, 81-87, 150-153, 182-185).
Moriarty and Kerry Barrette (Barrette), who was CTI's next human resources manager, were members of CTI's senior management team and well versed in the ADA. (PSF 4, 10, 332-55, 358-62). Otherwise, both CTI's managerial and line staff was woefully uneducated about the ADA, disability discrimination, or any policies at CTI dealing with such issues. (See PSF 305-13, 315, 329-31). No CTI policy informed employees about the availability of reasonable accommodations, how to request an accommodation at CTI, or even much information about disability discrimination generally. (PSF 316-31).

BARR
Barr was a good employee who had worked at CTI for over six years performing clerical duties when she began having swelling, pain and blurriness in her eyes that made it difficult to perform her duties. (PSF 17-29). Barr was diagnosed with a type of corneal degeneration. (PSF 26-28). In May 2010, Barr told her supervisor, [*5]  Debra Gill, that she needed eye surgery and would be out no more than three months. (PSF 30). Her doctor, Dr. Sanan, sent a form to CTI indicating that Barr's treatment would last three to four months from beginning to end and that she was not unable to perform work of any kind (as she could work while her vision was recovering). (PSF 33-39). Barrette received and reviewed this form, but didn't ask Barr if she could return to work with restrictions or if CTI could accommodate her. (PSF 40-43, 69-75).
During her leave, Barr repeatedly contacted CTI to ensure she could return to work. (PSF 44-79). She contacted Gibbons twice and he referred her to Jones. (PSF 47-48). Barr called Jones repeatedly, but he told her that CTI would "follow company policy." (PSF 52-53). She begged him for her job, but he told her that her medical condition wasn't his problem and stopped taking her calls. (PSF 54-55). Barr talked to Shandy Copening, CTI's vice president. (PSF 56-65). Copening told Barr her job would be there for her and that CTI could use a temporary employee. (PSF 62-63). Jones and Barrette knew Barr had talked to Copening; Barrette knew Copening promised she could keep her job. (PSF 64-65). [*6]  CTI uses temporary employees about once a year, including one who has been on the payroll for four years, and these employees are ineligible to the benefits regular employees receive. (PSF 104-08, 113-14). CTI hired a temporary employee, Darlene Meda, to cover Barr's duties during her leave. (PSF 109-10).
Barr spoke with Barrette several times and asked if she could have her job back. (PSF 66-68). Barrette asked Barr for a doctor's release, but did not contact Barr's doctor or consider that she might need an accommodation. (PSF 70-72). A number of reasonable accommodations can assist visually impaired employees to perform clerical duties and CTI knew about these accommodations. (PSF 96-99). Jones stated there was "no reason why" CTI couldn't have brought Barr back if she had vision in one eye and that it would not have been an undue hardship for CTI to hire a temporary employee to perform her duties for another three months. (PSF 89-90). But no one — from Gibbons to Gill — ever explored reasonable accommodations like this, or an extended leave, with Barr or contacted her doctor for more information. (See PSF 44-80, 80, 91-95). Instead, Barrette sent Barr a letter stating that if she [*7]  was not "released to full, unrestricted duty on or before August 2, 2010, [her] employment and health benefits [might] be terminated." (PSF 81-85). On August 2, 2010, CTI notified Barr by letter that it was firing her because she had exhausted her leave and couldn't return to full, unrestricted duty. (PSF 86-88).
That same month, CTI hired Meda into Barr's old position as a regular employee while Barr continued to undergo surgeries. (See PSF 109-10, 112-14, 118-39). It took three to six months to train her. (PSF 111). When Meda left, CTI hired a replacement without contacting Barr to ask if she would like to be rehired. (PSF 115-117). Barr reached maximum recovery by March 2011 but could have returned to work for periods during her recovery with an accommodation. (See PSF 118, 123-128, 130, 132-139).

Pruett
Pruett was a truck driver and a good employee. (PSF 140-41). He took leave following his hospitalization for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). (PSF 142-46). In July 2010, Pruett called Barrette to see what he needed to do to get back to work; Barrette told him he had to have a doctor's release. (PSF 147). On August 16, 2010, Barrette wrote to Pruett to tell him CTI was [*8]  firing him. (PSF 150-51). At the time, Barrette knew that Pruett had taken leave due to a disability and knew from talking to him that he hoped to be released to work soon. (PSF 148-49). But no one at CTI ever contacted Pruett or his doctor about his medical leave or medical condition prior to his termination, and Barrette never evaluated his ability to return to work with accommodations. (See PSF 150, 164-66). Pruett had worked for CTI for over seven years at the time. (PSF 153). His doctor released him to work, and at the time CTI fired him, he could have driven a truck at CTI hauling commodities that did not generate significant dust (like copper concentrate). (PSF 154-56, 167). He went to work shortly after as a driver and did not use oxygen during his workday, and his commercial driver's license has never expired. (PSF 154-55, 168). Pruett knew of an opening at CTI for an assistant to the diesel mechanic and two openings for safety supervisors. (PSF 157-58, 161). Pruett had worked as a lead mechanic and would have been qualified for the assistant position, and he also had a wealth of relevant experience and knowledge that would have served CTI well in the safety supervisor positions. [*9]  (PSF 159, 162). Pruett knew CTI's routes and customers and thinks he could also have worked as a dispatcher. (PSF 160). But CTI terminated him without evaluating any of these positions or his qualifications. (PSF 163).

Wolfe
Wolfe also drove trucks for CTI when he tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). (PSF 169-71, 174). Barrette knew Wolfe had a medical condition and had restrictions, so CTI initially granted him some leave. (PSF 171). On December 7, 2010, Wolfe's doctor released him to light duty, and he immediately advised both his manager and the human resources department. (PSF 175-78). When he asked if there was anything he could do, they told him they'd get back to him. (Id.). Barrette knew Wolfe wanted to return to work and remembers he had conversations with his manager about light duty. (PSF 179-80). Rather than discussing any other accommodations with Wolfe, CTI fired him on or about December 16, 2010 - before the twelve weeks of medical leave it typically granted its employees had expired. (PSF 181-82, 185, 271-72). Barrette called Wolfe and told him to reapply when he "was able to work at full capacity." (PSF 187-88). Wolfe had surgery and was again released to light [*10]  duty on March 11, 2011. (PSF 189-90). On June 6, 2011, he was released to full duty and called CTI to see if he could be rehired. (PSF 191-92). He was told to reapply at the terminal, so he did. (PSF 193). When CTI did not hire him, he worked as a driver for another company. (PSF 194-95).

Dittmer
Driver Roger Dittmer was off work due to heart attacks on three occasions during the course of his employment with CTI. (PSF 196-197, 210). The first time, CTI's supervisors told him he needed a full medical release without restrictions to return to work or he would be fired. (See PSF 198-99). Supervisor Marvin Borders never discussed Dittmer's ability to return to work with restrictions with him, telling him that if he couldn't drive, he couldn't work for CTI. (PSF 200). The next time CTI told him to get a full doctor's release and to "make sure it's with no restrictions on there." (PSF 201). Dittmer knew there was work he could have done, like doing time cards or inventory, or checking the vehicles' registrations, and was particularly interested in an accommodation because he felt he needed additional recovery time. (PSF 203-07).When CTI did not communicate with him about accommodations, he [*11]  "talk[ed his] doctors into signing" a release to get back to driving about six weeks later and gave it to CTI. (PSF 208-09).

Edmonds
Edmonds, a diesel mechanic, was injured in October 2009. (PSF 212-16). His supervisor, Victor Bruzee, and Tom Kromberg, the shop foreman, told him that he had to get a full doctor's release with no restrictions. (PSF 214, 217-21, 226). Edmonds repeatedly told Kromberg and others that he wanted and needed to return to work, and though he could not do his duties as a mechanic, he could have done light duty work (like dispatch or office work) if CTI had offered it. (PSF 223-25). But CTI never talked to Edmonds about these options and never offered him light duty. (PSF 224, 227-28). So Edmonds never sought a partial release and persuaded his doctor to release him to full duty months before he was healed just to get back to work. (PSF 222, 229-30).

Wielgus
Wielgus was a driver at CTI when he was hospitalized for an ulcer that caused internal bleeding. (PSF 231-33). Supervisor Robert Frank called him between three to four times to tell him he needed a full work release and to ask him why he was taking so long to get one. (PSF 234-35). Wielgus knew of CTI's policy [*12]  from a conversation with another supervisor during a previous illness. (PSF 237-38). Frank told him that he "made too big of a stink" as Frank knew "plenty of people with ulcers [who] went back to work the next day." (PSF 241). He threatened to come and take Wielgus' truck if he couldn't get a release. (PSF 236). Though Wielgus felt he was rushing it to return to work so soon, he provided CTI with a work release because of the pressure he received from Frank. (PSF 239-40). No one at CTI asked if he could work with restrictions, offered him light duty, or discussed his condition with him or his supervisor. (See PSF 242-43).

Platzer
Driver David Platzer suffered an injury that caused asthma attacks when he was exposed to lime. (PSF 259-63). His doctor released him to work but stated that he could not be around lime. (PSF 264). Platzer knew CTI had driving jobs available that didn't involve lime, but CTI refused to permit him to drive non-lime routes. (PSF 265-67). His manager said CTI had hired him to haul lime and he couldn't work at CTI if he couldn't do that. (PSF 268). So CTI fired him. (PSF 269).

STANDARD OF REVIEW

A. Motion for Summary Judgment
A court must grant summary judgment if [*13]  the pleadings and supporting documents, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, "show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Under summary judgment practice, the moving party bears the initial responsibility of presenting the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the record, together with affidavits, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.
If the moving party meets its initial responsibility, the burden then shifts to the opposing party who must demonstrate the existence of a factual dispute and that the fact in contention is material, i.e., a fact that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law, Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986), and that the dispute is genuine, i.e., the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party. Id. at 250; see Triton Energy Corp. v. Square D. Co., 68 F.3d 1216, 1221 (9th Cir. 1995). Rule 56(e) compels the non-moving party to "set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial" and not to "rely merely on allegations or denials in its own pleading." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The opposing party need not establish a material issue of fact conclusively in its favor; it is sufficient [*14]  that "the claimed factual dispute be shown to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth at trial." First Nat'l Bank of Arizona v. Cities Serv. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 288-89, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1968). However, Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment against a party who, after adequate time for discovery, fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case and on which the party will bear the burden of proof at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23.
When considering a summary judgment motion, the court examines the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). At summary judgment, the judge's function is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. The evidence of the non-movant is "to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor." Id. at 255. But if the evidence of the non-moving party is merely colorable or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted. Id. at 249-50.

B. ADA
This action is brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § §12101, et seq. The ADA was first enacted in 1990 and became effective July 26, 1992. The legislative purposes of, and findings for, the ADA [*15]  are set forth in § 12101 and are very broad. Essentially, the ADA provides a national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities in critical areas such as employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and access to public services. § 12101(a)(3) and (b). As the Supreme Court has observed, "[t]o effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids discrimination against disabled individuals in major areas of public life, among them employment (Title I of the Act) [42 U.S.C. §§ 12111-12117], public services (Title II) [§§ 12131-12165], and public accommodations (Title III) [§§ 12181-12189]." PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 675, 121 S. Ct. 1879, 149 L. Ed. 2d 904 (2001). Title I protects only employees of employers with 15 or more employees. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(5)(A).
The elements of an employment claim under the ADA are identical regardless of whether the defendant is a private employer (Title I) or a public entity (Title II). Those elements are that the claimant has a disability (as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)), that the claimant is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, and that the claimant has suffered adverse employment action because of the disability. Hutton v. Elf Atochem N. Am., Inc., 273 F.3d 884, 895 (9th Cir.2001). A plaintiff's remedies under the ADA are the same remedies available under Title VII governing employment discrimination. 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a).

DISCUSSION

A. Motion for Summary Judgment [*16]  (Doc. 117)

1. Qualified Individuals under the ADA, Ctns 1, 2: Barr, Pruiett and Wolfe

a. Test
The ADA defines "qualified individual" as an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. Consideration must be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job. 42 U.S.C.A. § 12111(8). The analysis of whether an individual is a qualified individual under the ADA occurs in two steps: first, whether the individual can perform the essential functions of the position and, second, if the individual is unable to perform those essential functions, whether any reasonable accommodation by the employer would allow the individual to do so. Phelps v. Optima Health, Inc., 251 F.3d 21 (1st Cir. 2001). Only a minimal showing of qualification is required to establish a prima facie ADA claim; a plaintiff only needs to demonstrate that he or she possesses the basic skills necessary for performance of the job. Sista v. CDC Ixis North America, Inc., 445 F.3d 161 (2d Cir. 2006). If a plaintiff is unable to perform essential [*17]  function, even with reasonable accommodation, he is not qualified individual for purposes of Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); in other words, a plaintiff who is totally disabled and unable to work at all is precluded from suing for discrimination under ADA. 42 U.S.C.(2006 ed.) § 12111(8); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1).
The determination whether an employee is qualified under ADA must be made as of the time of the employment decision. Bay v. Cassens Transport Co., 212 F.3d 969 (7th Cir. 2000). Thus, a plaintiff may not rely upon past performance to establish that he or she is a qualified individual if the employer has produced undisputed evidence of diminished or deteriorated abilities. Mole v. Buckhorn Rubber Products, Inc., 165 F.3d 1212 (8th Cir. 1999). The second element of the ADA claim that the plaintiff must prove is that the plaintiff is a qualified individual under the ADA. The term qualified individual means an individual with a disability who, with or without a reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. The individual must satisfy the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment position. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111 (employment-related definitions); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(m) (qualified individual); Smith, 727 F.3d at 956-58.

b. Do Barr, Pruiett and Wolfe meet the test?
Plaintiff argues [*18]  that the test has been met. Barr had Fuch's endothelial dystrophy, which substantially limited her ability to see. (PSF 24, 26, 28). Pruett had COPD, which substantially limited the operation of his body's respiratory functions. (PSF 142, 145-46). Wolfe had a torn ACL, which substantially limited his ability to walk and stand. (PSF 170, 173-74). Additional leave time could plausibly have permitted Barr, Pruett, and Wolfe to perform their job duties satisfactorily upon their return and they are therefore qualified individuals. (See PSF 95, 118, 126, 132-34, 137-39, 154-62, 167-68, 175-81, 189-95). Second, Barr, Pruett and Wolfe did not request or need indefinite leave. All three could potentially have returned to work with reasonable accommodations. Reasonable accommodations in the form of adaptive technology, glasses, or additional leave beyond the required FMLA leave could have enabled Barr to continue to perform her job duties. (PSF 36, 39, 95-99, 123-30, 132-34, 137-39). Similarly, CTI could have reasonably accommodated Pruett by permitting him additional leave, reassigning him to a different commodity, or reassigning him to a non-driving position. Pruett was able to return to work [*19]  as a driver when CTI fired him; he went to work as a driver shortly after with no lapse in his commercial driver's license. (PSF 154-55, 168). CTI could have reasonably accommodated Wolfe by permitting him additional leave through June 2011, when he was released to full duty and unsuccessfully reapplied to CTI. (PSF 191-95). CTI permitted extended leaves in similar situations — when one driver fractured his wrist playing sports, CTI granted him over five months of leave and continued his leave even when his return date "kept getting pushed out a little bit more." (PSF 275; see also PSF 273, 277-82).
Defendant argues that the test has not been met. Elizabeth Barr was a payroll clerk (DSOF3 15) whose job included the essential function of using a computer (DSOF 20-22) several hours per day (DSOF 18). Barr suffered from a serious eye disease (DSOF 24,25) which caused her vision to substantially deteriorate (DSOF27), and as a result she could not perform her job (DSOF 33-34). Barr was granted a medical leave effective May 1, 2010 (DSOF 35-37). On May, 18, 2010, Barr provided CTI a "Certification of Health Care Provider" but does not recall if she ever provided CTI with any other medical [*20]  information (DSOF 65-67, 97-98, 103). Barr does not recall asking CTI for any accommodation other than to keep her job open (DSOF 115-122). Barr does not know whether she was capable of working on an interim basis during her leave (DSOF 71-72) , or whether she was able to perform any of the essential functions of her job within 3-4 months of the commencement of her leave (DSOF 73). Barr does not know whether she asked CTI to extend her leave (DSOF 134-137) or whether any additional leave time offered by CTI would have allowed her to perform the essential functions of her job (DSOF 139). Barr also testified she does not even know whether, between May 2, 2010 and September, 2011-16 months later-she could have performed any of the essential functions of her job (DSOF 76-81). Barr's employment was terminated on August 2, 2010 (DSOF 140). Barr does not recall whether, as of August 2, 2010, she ever notified CTI as to when she expected to return to work, or even whether she knew when she would be able to return to work (DSOF 88-89). In fact, Barr does not recall any time ever providing CTI notice as to when she would be able to return to work (DSOF 90). However, CTI clearly recalls Barr [*21]  was unable to provide a return date or time frame as of August 2, 2010: Tom Jones, CTI's President (DSOF 5) repeatedly asked Barr in several phone calls-which occurred after her certification of health care provider form was provided CTI (DSOF 748)2-when she would be able to return but she never had any idea. (DSOF 744-750; 815-19.)
Pruett was a truck driver (DSOF 181-82) who was hospitalized in March, 2010, with severe hypoxia pneumonia (DSOF 206). As a result of his medical condition, Pruett was on leave for 19 weeks, from April 30th through August 16, 2010, the date his employment was terminated (DSOF 207,209,248). On April 30, 2010, when Pruett spoke to Kerry Ramirez, CTI's HR Manager (DSOF 820-28) he did not know when he would be able to return to work. (DSOF 217). Pruett does not remember whether as of August 16, 2010 he provided any kind of release to CTI (DSOF 261). In fact, to date, CTI has never received any kind of release releasing Pruett back to work (DSOF 263). As of the time of the termination of his employment, Pruett does not recall giving CTI a date by which he could return (DSOF 264). Pruett's employment was terminated because after 19 weeks of leave, he "was not [*22]  released to work, nor was there any indication that he would ever be released to work" (DSOF 986).
Wolfe was a truck driver who began employment at CTI September 28, 2010 (DSOF 479-81) and was injured less than one month later (DSOF 498) when he tore his ACL (PSOF 169-71, 174). Wolfe's employment was terminated because there was no approximate return date or duration for his leave. (DSOF 1023) Plaintiff claims "CTI could have reasonably accommodated Wolfe by permitting him additional leave through June 2011, when he was released to full duty and unsuccessfully reapplied to CTI. "Response, p.20. This argument is based on information that could not have been known to CTI at the time: Wolfe testified that it was not until May 9, 2011, five months after the termination of his employment, that Dr. Greenfield told Wolfe when approximately he would be able to return to work (DSOF 568); and that it was not until May 9, 2011 that Wolfe would have been able to tell CTI an expected return date (DSOF 569), which was June 11, 2011 (DSOF 593).
In sum, the EEOC has put forth more than enough material facts to suggest that a jury could find in favor of its position. Ultimately, this is a fact question [*23]  for the jury to resolve. See Ninth Circuit Jury Instruction, Civil 12.6.

2. Qualified Individuals based on Ability to Meet the Requirements of the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act (MCSA), an Essential Function: Pruett, Wolfe, Dittmer, Weilgus, Edmonds

a. Test
The term "essential functions" means fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires. 41 C.F.R. § 60-741.2(u)(1); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1). The term "essential functions" does not include the marginal functions of the position. Id. A job function may be considered essential for any of several reasons, including but not limited to the following:(1) The function may be essential because the reason the position exists is to perform that function;(2) The function may be essential because of the limited number of employees available among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed; and/or(3) The function may be highly specialized so that the incumbent in the position is hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular function. Id. Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes, but is not limited to:(1) The contractor's or employer's judgment as to which functions are essential;(2) [*24]  Written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job;(3) The amount of time spent on the job performing the function;(4) The consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function;(5) The terms of a collective bargaining agreement;(6) The work experience of past incumbents in the job; and/or(7) The current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs. Id.
Since a determination of the essential job functions is a fact-specific inquiry, where questions of fact exist as to whether particular tasks are essential functions of the plaintiff's position and whether the plaintiff can perform those tasks, summary judgment must be denied. Wenner v. City of New York Dept. of Sanitation, 14 A.D.D. 983, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 648 (S.D. N.Y. 1996).4 The complex question of what constitutes an essential job function for purposes of the ADA involves fact-sensitive considerations and must be determined on a case-by-case basis. Richardson v. Friendly Ice Cream Corp., 594 F.3d 69 (1st Cir. 2010).

b. Could Plaintiff meet the essential function test: Pruett, Wolfe, Dittmer, Weilgus, Edmonds?
Dittmer had three heart attacks, which substantially impaired the operation of his cardiac functions. (PSF 197). Edmonds had an injury to his knee and foot which substantially limited his ability to walk and stand. (PSF 213, 215). Wielgus [*25]  had an ulcer that caused internal bleeding and substantially limited his bowel and circulatory functions. (PSF 233). Pruett, Edmonds, Dittmer, and Wielgus could have performed the job duties of other positions, including the light duty positions to which CTI frequently assigns injured drivers. CTI did not need to do anything that would have run afoul of its duties under the MCSA to reasonably accommodate Pruett, Wolfe, Dittmer, Edmonds, or Wielgus. It could have provided any number of accommodations (including but not limited to additional leave, reassignment to vacant positions, assignments transporting other commodities, and light duty) that did not implicate its obligations under the MCSA. (See PSF 62-63, 89-90, 95-99, 117, 123-28, 130, 132-34, 138-39, 154-62, 175-77, 181, 189-95, 202-08, 223-25, 243). CTI knows that, because it has granted drivers extended leaves, reassigned drivers to haul other commodities, and reassigned them to light duty work, all without running afoul of its obligations under the MCSA. (PSF 270-82, 285-304).
It was CTI's duty to examine the feasibility of these accommodations rather than assuming that its obligation to comply with the MCSA was inconsistent [*26]  with the ADA. Defendant's assertion that its full, unrestricted duty policy "may be related to 'CTI's compliance with its duty to provide safe drivers on the road under federal laws'" is completely unsupported. Dkt. 117, at pp. 14. At best, Defendant's authority states that disabled employees who hold positions covered by the MCSA must be able to satisfy physical qualification standards to drive covered vehicles. See Dkt. 117, at p. 14; Albertson's v. Kirkingburg, 527 U.S. 555, 573-74, 119 S. Ct. 2162, 144 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1999). No authority supports the sweeping assertion that employers need not reasonably accommodate employees subject to the MCSA, and the MCSA did not compel CTI to adopt or implement these policies and practices. Dkt. 117, at p. 15.
Again, ultimately, this is a fact question for resolution by a jury. See Ninth Circuit Jury Instruction, Civil 12.7.

3. Legitimate Nondiscriminatory Business Reasons

a. Test
Assuming without deciding that plaintiff has established a prima facie disparate treatment claim, the court must then determine if the defendant has articulated and submitted evidence of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for the challenged actions. See Bodett v. Cox Com, Inc., 366 F.3d 736, 744 (9th Cir.2004); Vasquez v. County of Los Angeles, 349 F.3d 634, 641 (9th Cir.2003) (transfer of an employee who disobeyed a direct order from a supervisor was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory [*27]  reason).
If the defendant has raised articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the challenged actions, plaintiff must "raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether the defendant's proffered reasons ... are mere pretext for unlawful discrimination." Hawn v. Executive Jet Management, 615 F.3d 1151, 1155-56 (9th Cir. 2010). "'[A] plaintiff can prove pretext in two ways: (1) indirectly, by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence because it is internally inconsistent or otherwise not believable, or (2) directly, by showing that unlawful discrimination more likely motivated the employer.'" Noyes v. Kelly Services, 488 F.3d 1163, 1170 (9th Cir. 2007)(citation omitted).
Direct evidence is evidence "which, if believed, proves the fact [of discriminatory animus] without inference or presumption." Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1221 (9th Cir.1998) (quoting Davis v. Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., 14 F.3d 1082, 1085 (5th Cir.1994)) (alteration in original). Direct evidence typically consists of clearly sexist, racist, or similarly discriminatory statements or actions by the employer. See, e.g., Godwin, 150 F.3d at 1221 (supervisor stated he "did not want to deal with [a] female"); Cordova v. State Farm Ins., 124 F.3d 1145, 1149 (9th Cir.1997) (alleged derogatory comments constitute direct evidence).
"Where evidence of pretext is circumstantial, rather than direct, the plaintiff must produce 'specific' and 'substantial' facts to create a triable issue of pretext." Earl v. Nielsen Media Research, Inc., 658 F.3d 1108, 1113 (9th Cir.2011) (quoting Godwin, 150 F.3d at 1222). "[T]hat [*28]  requirement is tempered by our observation that, in the context of Title VII claims, the burden on plaintiffs to raise a triable issue of fact as to pretext is 'hardly an onerous one.'" Noyes, 488 F.3d at 1170 (quoting Payne v. Norwest Corp., 113 F.3d 1079, 1080 (9th Cir.1997)). Nonetheless, a "plaintiff cannot create a genuine issue of pretext to survive a motion for summary judgment by relying solely on unsupported speculations and allegations of discriminatory intent." Crawford v. MCI Worldcom Communications, Inc., 167 F.Supp.2d 1128, 1135 (S.D.Cal.2001). Moreover, "[m]erely denying the credibility of the employer's proffered reasons is insufficient to withstand summary judgment." Munoz v. Mabus, 630 F.3d 856, 865 (9th Cir.2010).

b. Defendant's Proffered nondiscriminatory reasons
CTI's non-discriminatory business reasons for the decisions about which Plaintiff complains are: (1) Barr, Pruett, Wolfe: their leaves were indefinite and there was no reasonable basis to conclude when they could return (DSOF 87-92; 960 (Barr); 264; 986-990 (Pruett); 565-569; 1012-1016; 1019-1025 (Wolfe)); (2) Pruett, Wolfe, Weilgus, Dittmer and Edmonds: they were not qualified to perform their jobs in light of of MCSA regulations;(DSOF 254-262 (Pruett); 508-512; 525-542 (Wolfe); (424-25; 456 (Dittmer); 319-323 (Weilgus); 614-15; 625-31 (Edmonds,); (3) Pruett, Wolfe, Dittmer and Edmonds they are unable to identify vacant [*29]  positions for which they were qualified;(DSOF (Pruett 272-287);(Wolfe 552, 561, 574; 591-92); (Dittmer 466-467); (Edmonds 679-682); (4) Weilgus and Edmonds neither sought nor desired light duty or any other accommodation (DSOF (Weilgus 362-67); (Edmonds 673-77; 682-83; 685; 688-89)) and both voluntarily resigned (DSOF (Weilgus 296-99); (Edmonds 690-690C). It is Plaintiff's burden to show these reasons were a mere pretext for discrimination. Snead v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1094 (9 Cir. 2001). In order to prove pretext, Plaintiff must produce "specific" and "substantial" evidence CTI's reasons are "false" or "unworthy of credence." Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., 530 U.S. 133, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2001).(Doc. 117 at 11-12.)

c. Pretext
The EEOC argues that a reasonable jury could find that Defendant's proffered business reasons are pretextual. The EEOC can prove pretext "either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." Tex. Dep't of Comm. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). "Proof that the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence . . . is probative of intentional discrimination, and it can be quite persuasive." Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, 530 U.S. 133, 134, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) (citation omitted). The same evidence utilized in the prima facie case may be considered [*30]  in evaluating pretext. Id. at 143.
Here, the fact that Defendant consistently represented that it fired Barr, Pruett, and Wolfe due to their inability to return to full, unrestricted duty, when contrasted with its current insistence that it had so many other reasons for doing so, may lead a jury to believe that these reasons are mere pretext for discrimination. See Washington v. Garrett, 10 F.3d 1421, 1434 (9th Cir. 1993) (fundamentally different justifications for an employer's action can support finding of pretext). CTI's assertion that its policy was necessitated by the MCSA may also ring false to the jury, given that CTI applied it to clerical employees like Barr. Likewise, the jury could readily infer that CTI's assertion that Barr, Pruett, and Wolfe were on indefinite leave is pretextual. In this case, the conflicting evidence is more than sufficient to permit a factfinder to determine that CTI's alleged reasons are pretextual and find for the EEOC.
Summary judgment is inappropriate. See McGinest, 360 F.3d 1103, 1124 (9th Cir. 2004) (uncertainty at the summary judgment stage must be resolved in plaintiff's favor).

4. Weilgus should be out on all counts
Weilgus was off work "10 or 12 days" (DSOF 321),does not contend he should have been returned to work earlier (DSOF 362), never desired light [*31]  duty (DSOF 364), and does not even believe he was subject to disability discrimination (DSOF 369-70). Instead, he complains about conversations he claims he had with his supervisor, Robert Frank (DSOF 335-361). Weilgus testified he felt "harassed" (DSOF 340) "sometimes" (DSOF 341) because of his "medical condition "(DSOF 353), but he never reported this to CTI because he "really didn't see a need" for it (DSOF 351). Defendant argues that, at most, his claim is a "hostile work environment claim".
Ultimately, whether or not the individual believes his rights under the ADA were violated is irrelevant because it requires an understanding of legal conclusions generally not within the realm of understanding of the lay person. The EEOC is charged with the duty of enforcing the laws that are intended to stop discrimination in the workplace.

5. Counts 3, 4 Contain no Evidence of Disparate Impact

a. Test
To show a prima facie case of disparate treatment under the ADA, Plaintiff must show that, within the meaning of the statute, he: "(1) is disabled; (2) is qualified; and (3) suffered an adverse employment action because of [his] disability." Snead, 237 F.3d at 1087. Plaintiff must also show that the complained-of action [*32]  "materially" affected a term of his employment. Davis, 520 F.3d at 1089. To survive summary judgment on a disparate impact claim, a plaintiff must provide at least some evidence, direct or circumstantial, that a facially neutral policy falls more harshly on a protected group than the whole. Lopez v. Pac. Maritime Ass'n, 657 F.3d 762, 766 (9th Cir.2011). A prima facie case of disparate impact is usually accomplished by statistical evidence showing that an employment practice selects members of a protected class in a proportion smaller than their percentage in the pool of actual applicants. Although statistical data alone, in a proper case, may be adequate to prove causation, the statistical disparities must be sufficiently substantial that they raise such an inference of causation. Stout v. Potter, 276 F.3d 1118, 1122 (9th Cir.2002) (citations omitted.) The EEOC has produced the requisite amount of circumstantial evidence to raise a material question of fact on this point.

b. Adverse Impact
Section 102(b)(3) makes it unlawful for employers to "utilize standards, criteria, or methods of administration that have the effect of discrimination on the basis of disability . . ." 42 U.S.C.§ 12112(b)(3). Section 102(b)(6) makes it unlawful for an employer to use qualification standards or selection criteria that screen out individuals with disabilities unless the standard (as applied) [*33]  is "shown to be job-related for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(6); see 29 C.F.R. 1630.7 (applying defense to claims under Section 102(b)(3)). To make out a prima facie claim on these claims, a plaintiff must (1) identify the challenged employment practice or policy and pinpoint the defendant's use of it; (2) demonstrate an adverse impact on a group that falls within the protective class; and (3) demonstrate a causal relationship between the identified practice and the adverse impact. See Gonzales v. City of New Braunfels, Tex., 176 F.3d 834, 839 fn. 26 (5th Cir. 1999). In Gonzalez, referencing both Sections 102(b)(3) and 102(b)(6), the court explained that "[i]n the ADA context, a plaintiff may satisfy the second prong of his prima facie case by demonstrating an adverse impact on himself rather than on an entire group." Gonzales, at 839, fn. 26 (citation omitted). Where, as here, a policy actually screens out people with disabilities, it is disparate treatment and renders the statistical evidence unnecessary. Contrary to CTI's assertion, the EEOC does not need to provide any statistical evidence for these claims. See Bates v. UPS, 511 F.3d 974 (9th Cir. 2007) (addressing a disparate treatment claim in the context of Section 102(b)(6) without requiring statistical evidence).
It is then Defendant's burden to prove that its discriminatory qualification standards are a business [*34]  necessity. Cripe v. City of San Jose, 261 F.3d 877, 890 (9th Cir. 2001); Bates, 511 F.3d at 994-95. Defendant must demonstrate that no reasonable jury could find for the EEOC in order to prevail on summary judgment. Soremekun, 509 F.3d at 984. "To successfully assert the business necessity defense..., an employer bears the burden of showing that the qualification standard is (1) job related, (2) consistent with business necessity, and (3) that performance cannot be accomplished by reasonable accommodation." Bates, 511 F.3d at 996 (citations and internal quotations omitted).
Again, both sides raise material questions of fact on this point precluding resolution by dispositive motion.

6. Is Engaging in Interactive Process Mandatory?
Plaintiff argues: (1) "An 'employer cannot prevail at the summary judgment stage if there is a genuine issue as to whether the employer engaged in good faith in the interactive process.' Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1116", Response, p. 10-11; and (2) "The employer's mandatory obligation to engage in the interactive process is triggered when it becomes aware of an employee's need for an adjustment due to a medical condition" (Response, p.11).
"To determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the qualified individual with a disability [*35]  in need of accommodation...." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). The EEOC interpretive guideline provides : "Once a qualified individual with a disability has requested provision of a reasonable accommodation, the employer must make a reasonable effort to determine the appropriate accommodation...." 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. § 1630.9 at 359. Humphrey v. Memorial Hospitals Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001) holds: "We conclude, as a matter of law, that (assuming Humphrey was a qualified individual with a disability), [Memorial Hospitals Assoc.] (MHA) had an affirmative duty under the ADA to explore further methods of accommodation before terminating Humphrey."
Whether or not the Defendant sufficiently engaged in the interactive process remains a question of fact for a jury to resolve.

B. Punitive Damages Claim
42 U.S.C. §1981a(b)(2) provides for recovery of compensatory and punitive damages against a defendant who violates §102(b)(5) of the ADA by failing to make a reasonable accommodation. Punitive damages are available when an employer acts in the face of a perceived risk that its actions will violate federal law to be liable in punitive damages. Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n, 527 U.S. 526, 536, 119 S. Ct. 2118, 144 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1999); 42 U.S.C. §1981a(b)(1). An employer's attempt to cover up its actions can support an award of punitive damages. Passantino v. Johnson & Johnson Consumer Prods., Inc., 212 F.3d 493, 515-16 (9th Cir. 2000).
Plaintiff argues that this is not a case where Defendant was "unaware of the relevant federal prohibition," where [*36]  the Commission's legal theories are "novel or otherwise poorly recognized," or where CTI was under a mistaken impression that its conduct was lawful. See Kolstad, 527 U.S. at 536-37. On the other hand, Plaintiff has not produced evidence of an overt attempt to cover up illegal actions.
Here and during oral argument, the Plaintiff raised material questions of fact going to the merits of this action but did not do so with reference to the issue of punitive damages. All in all, the EEOC did not put forth sufficient circumstantial evidence that a reasonable jury could find that Defendant acted with malice or reckless disregard of the aggrieved individuals' rights under the ADA distinct from the allegations forming the basis for the alleged ADA violations.
Accordingly,
IT IS ORDERED that the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 117) is DENIED.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on the Claim for Punitive Damages (Doc. 118) is GRANTED.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the parties should file a Joint Proposed Pretrial Statement on or before August 7, 2015.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a pretrial conference is set for September 14, 2015 at 1:30 p.m. in courtroom 6B.
DATED this 7 th day of May, [*37]  2015.
