Opinion



REPORT & RECOMMENDATION
TO: THE HONORABLE GEORGE B. DANIELS, United States District Judge
FROM: KATHARINE H. PARKER, United States Magistrate Judge
Plaintiff Alexander Anderson is a former employee of Defendant New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation ("HHC"), where he was a social worker at the Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center ("Lincoln Hospital"). Plaintiff commenced this action in February of 2016 and asserts a litany of claims against Defendant HHC and Defendant Athena Motal, the Senior Associate Director of Hospitals in the Social Services Department ("SSD") at Lincoln Hospital from October of 2011 until August of 2014. Plaintiff's claims [*2]  are all brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq. ("Title VII"), and the New York City Human Rights Law, New York City Administrative Code §§8-101 et seq. ("NYCHRL"). He alleges that Defendants discriminated against him on the basis of his race, color, sex, age, disability, and status as an African-American male, that he was subject to retaliation after he complained about Defendants' discriminatory practices, and that he was forced to endure a hostile work environment while employed by Defendant HHC. Defendants HHC and Motal have now moved for summary judgment to dismiss Plaintiff's claims. For the reasons set forth below, I respectfully recommend that Defendants' Motion be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.

BACKGROUND1

I. Plaintiff Begins Working at Lincoln Hospital
Plaintiff is a "dark skinned" African-American male born in 1959. (Doc. No. 181 ("Anderson Aff.") ¶ 1.) He obtained his bachelor's degree in History from Syracuse University in 1985 and a master's degree in social work ("MSW") from Hunter College in 2008. Plaintiff became a Credentialed Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Counselor ("CASAC") in 2008 and a [*3]  Licensed Master Social Worker ("LMSW") in 2009. Plaintiff was not a Licensed Clinical Social Worker ("LCSW") while employed by Defendant HHC. Plaintiff was employed by Defendant HHC at Lincoln Hospital from August 29, 2011 until July 21, 2017. During Plaintiff's tenure at Lincoln Hospital, social workers were classified as Level I, Level II, Level III, Level IV or Level V. Social workers at Levels III through V had supervisory positions, and Level I and II social workers had no official supervisory duties, but could be delegated such duties by their own supervisors.
Plaintiff began working at Lincoln Hospital in the SSD as a Social Worker Level I in the Program to Address Substance Abuse ("PASA"). The program identified those patients who were en route to the emergency room and required substance abuse treatment, and referred those patients to substance abuse programs. While Plaintiff worked in PASA, the program was staffed by one physician, two social workers, and two case workers, with the social workers and caseworkers essentially performing the same functions. Another social worker supervisor managed the staff assigned to PASA, as well as to other programs and units, but did not [*4]  deal directly with patients. Helen Esanbor was the PASA supervisor when Plaintiff joined the program. Esanbor was a Level V Social Worker who supervised other programs in addition to PASA. She is an African-American female born in 1955.
Plaintiff claims that, not long after he began working in PASA, he was instructed by Dr. Abdul Mondul, then Chief Patient and Safety Officer who oversaw PASA, and Christina Laboy, then Associate Director of Social Work at Lincoln Hospital, to supervise addiction counselors. (Anderson Aff. ¶ 6.) Plaintiff subsequently began providing clinical supervision to PASA addiction counselors Alex Aleman, Anette Burwell, and Duane Murray. (Id.; Doc. No. 182 ("Burwell Aff.") ¶¶ 1-2; Doc. No. 180-64 ("Aleman Aff.") ¶ 3; Doc. No. 180-63 ("Laboy Aff.") ¶3.)

II. Plaintiff Seeks Promotion to PASA Supervisor and Alleges Discrimination by Motal
In or about December of 2013, Esanbor was reassigned from PASA. Although there was no job posting for a standalone "PASA Supervisor" position, Plaintiff expressed a desire to become PASA Supervisor to Defendant Motal and Dr. Mondul. (Doc. No. 172-1 ("Anderson Dep. Tr.") 78:13-20.). Plaintiff did not memorialize this request in writing, [*5]  but testified that he made the request in person. (Id.) Plaintiff avers that after he discussed the PASA Supervisor position with Defendant Motal and Dr. Mondul, another doctor indicated to Plaintiff that it was her impression that Dr. Mondul believed Plaintiff did not "fit in" because there were "no black male managers at Lincoln Hospital." (Id. at 78:22-79:10.)
On or about December 13, 2013, Defendant Motal announced that Maria Kazaki-Maher, a Level IV social worker who was an LMSW and LCSW and had existing supervisory responsibilities over two other units, was chosen to supervise PASA. Kazaki-Maher is a white female born in 1974, obtained her MSW approximately six years before Plaintiff, and had over ten years of social work experience when she began supervising PASA. At around the same time Defendant Motal announced Kazaki-Maher's appointment as PASA Supervisor, Plaintiff met with Defendant Motal to discuss Kazaki-Maher's appointment. Plaintiff informed Defendant Motal that, by appointing Kazaki-Maher, she discriminated against him because he is African-American. At around the same time, Motal informed Plaintiff that she would recommend him for a discretionary promotion, from Social [*6]  Worker Level I to Social Worker Level II.
While Plaintiff was employed at Lincoln Hospital, the Hospital had a policy of only promoting individuals who had good attendance, satisfactory reviews, and no pending disciplinary actions. Plaintiff's evaluation for the time period between August 29, 2012 and August 28, 2013 indicates that he "need[ed] improvement" and that he was counseled due to "excessive absenteeism." (Doc. No. 172-17, 9.) As a result, Plaintiff was informed that he would be monitored for the next three months, until November 29, 2013. (Id.) Plaintiff's attendance issues were resolved shortly thereafter, and Defendant Motal and Esanbor formally submitted the paperwork requesting Plaintiff's promotion in or about December 2013 or January 2014. At that time, it could take as long as 200 days, and up to a year, from the time a department submitted a request for a promotion for the request to be approved.

III. Plaintiff Is Denied a Promotion to Social Worker Level III in the MCU and Alleges Discrimination by Motal and Dr. Mondul and Retaliation by Hill
On or about January 17, 2014, Lincoln Hospital posted a job opening for a Social Worker Level III position in the Mobile Crisis [*7]  Unit ("MCU").2 The job posting noted that competitive applicants, at minimum, were required to be an LMSW with at least one year of "full-time satisfactory post-licensure experience utilizing one or a combination of casework group work and community organization methodologies." (Doc. No. 172-12.) The posting did not expressly require "mobile crisis experience." (Id.) At that time Lilyn Hill, an African-American female born in 1955, was the Assistant Director of the Psychiatry Department and directly supervised the MCU. Defendant Motal forwarded Hill several applications for the Social Worker Level III position, including Plaintiff's. Hill selected Plaintiff, along with other candidates, for interviews. Defendant Motal conducted the initial interview, and subsequently referred Plaintiff for an additional, more in-depth interview with Hill. Nicole Robinson, then Associate Director of the SSD, also participated in Plaintiff's interview. Robinson is an African-American female born in 1970.
Hill made the final hiring decision and determined that Plaintiff was not qualified for the MCU position because he lacked mobile crisis experience. Plaintiff counters, however, that he possessed the requisite [*8]  experience because he "responded to many individuals in psychiatric crisis during [his] seven years with the [Bridge Bronx] ACT [Team]" and contends that he told Hill and Robinson about his relevant experience during his interview. (Doc. No. 184 ("Pl.'s Rule 56.1 Counterstatement") ¶ 81.) Hill, however, did not consider Plaintiff's experience with the Bridge Bronx ACT Team to be mobile crisis experience. (Doc. No. 172-31 ("Hill Aff.") ¶¶ 9-10.) Robinson also concluded that Plaintiff did not supervise addiction counselors because Level I Social Workers, such as Plaintiff, do not have official supervisory authority. As indicated in the functional job description of Plaintiff's position as a PASA Level I Social Worker, Plaintiff had the authority to supervise caseworkers and social work students "when designated." (Doc. No. 172-12.) Plaintiff stated in his resume that he supervised addiction counselors as a Level I Social Worker in PASA. (Doc. No. 180-23.)
Hill ultimately hired Jessica Erickson, an African-American female born in 1978, for the position. At the time of her interview on March 7, 2014, Erickson had been working as a social worker in the MCU since April 2013 through a third-party contractor. [*9]  As such, Hill was already familiar with Erickson's work product, writing skills, and clinical abilities, and knew that Erickson had gained mobile crisis experience while working at Lincoln Hospital. Hill also believed that Erickson was the only candidate she interviewed who had mobile crisis experience.
Nevertheless, Plaintiff contends that he should have been hired over Erickson because he had seven years of mobile crisis experience, compared to Erickson's single year of experience, when he applied for the MCU Social Worker Level III position, earned his LMSW approximately four years before Erickson, and was CASAC certified. He also claims that he should have been hired over Erickson because he had satisfactory evaluations and Lincoln Hospital had a policy of giving a hiring preference to qualified internal candidates for open positions, so long as those candidates had satisfactory evaluations and no pending disciplinary issues. (Pl.'s Rule 56.1 Counterstatement ¶ 88; see also Doc. No. 180-8 ("Marrero Dep. Tr.") 90:12-91:24.)
Plaintiff also asserts he was denied the MCU position because he informed Hill during his interview that he wanted to leave PASA because he felt that Defendant Motal and [*10]  Dr. Mondul discriminated against him by refusing to hire him as PASA Supervisor. Plaintiff contends that, although the interview with Hill had been going well until that point, Hill abruptly ended the interview when Plaintiff broached the topic of the discrimination he allegedly endured. Although Hill did not report to Defendant Motal, Plaintiff asserts that Motal played in role in the decision to hire Erickson over him because the relevant form submitted to human resources indicates that Motal had to approve any social worker hiring recommendations at Lincoln Hospital. (Doc. No. 172-34.)

IV. Plaintiff's Promotion to Social Worker Level II is Cancelled/Delayed
On March 27, 2014, Plaintiff sent an email directly to PASA addiction counselor Aleman, stating that Aleman's "approach to addressing [a] patient's concerns [was] inappropriate and unacceptable" after Aleman concluded that a certain patient did not meet the criteria for enrolling in a detox program (the "Aleman Email"). (Doc. No. 172-19.) Defendants contend that Plaintiff's supervisors believed that this email was unprofessional and inappropriate and that Plaintiff should have raised his concerns with his supervisor, Kazaki-Maher, [*11]  so that she could discuss the matter with Aleman.
The day after Plaintiff sent the email, Kazaki-Maher and Milly Toro, a Hispanic female born in 1956 and then Assistant Director of the Social Services Department, met with Plaintiff. During the meeting, Plaintiff was instructed to stop supervising Aleman and the other PASA addiction counselor. Defendants contend that Kazaki-Maher and Toro provided Plaintiff with verbal counseling regarding the impropriety of the Aleman Email. For his part, Plaintiff avers that he was expressly told that the meeting was not disciplinary in nature and that, if the meeting had been called to give him verbal counseling, he would have been entitled to have a union representative present.
Defendant Motal met with human resources in the Spring of 2014 to inquire about the status of Plaintiff's promotion to Social Worker Level II. She advised human resources that Plaintiff had received verbal counseling, but that the matter was closed. Although Defendants contend that Defendant Motal did not request that Plaintiff's promotion be cancelled, Plaintiff asserts that Motal cancelled his promotion in or about April of 2014. On or about July 28, 2014, Defendant Motal, [*12]  Toro, and Kazaki-Maher met with Plaintiff to discuss the status of his promotion. Plaintiff testified that during that meeting, Defendant Motal informed him that she was cancelling his promotion to Social Worker Level II due to the Aleman Email. In response, Plaintiff accused her of discriminating against him.

V. Plaintiff is Denied a Promotion to Social Worker Level III in the MICA Program and Alleges Discrimination and Retaliation by Motal
Plaintiff applied for a Social Worker Level III position in the Mentally Ill Chemical Abuse ("MICA") program, a component of the inpatient psychiatry unit of the SSD. The job posting indicated that competitive applicants, at a minimum, needed to be an LMSW and have "one year of full-time satisfactory post-licensure experience utilizing one or a combination of casework, group work, and community organization methodologies." (Doc. No. 172-35.) Plaintiff interviewed for the position with Defendant Motal and Robinson in or about May of 2014. During the interview, Plaintiff informed Motal that she should hire him because she allegedly discriminated against him and other African-American men.
Ilana Horowitz, a white female born in 1977, also applied for [*13]  the position. Horowitz had been employed as a social worker with HHC at Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center ("Woodhull") since May of 2006. She was promoted from Social Worker Level I to Social Worker Level II on February 14, 2014 while working at Woodhull. On or about May 13, 2014, Defendant Motal recommended Horowitz, who had eight years of relevant experience and was both an LMSW and LCSW, for the position. Defendants contend that Horowitz not only had more overall experience and licensing qualifications than Plaintiff, but also had more supervisory experience. For his part, Plaintiff counters that Horowitz did not necessarily have more supervisory experience than him because he gained supervisory experience before he began working at Lincoln Hospital while working on the Bridge Bronx ACT team and as a Level I Social Worker in PASA. Plaintiff also had a CASAC certification, which Horowitz lacked.

VI. Plaintiff Files Grievances Alleging Discrimination and Retaliation by Motal and Toro
On or about August 11, 2014, Plaintiff submitted a grievance to David Nadal, the director of labor relations at Defendant HHC, alleging, among other things, that Defendant Motal breached her oral [*14]  agreement with him to promote him to Social Worker Level II and wrongfully initiated disciplinary actions against him that resulted in the cancellation of that promotion. Plaintiff also alleged in the grievance that Defendant Motal discriminated against him by denying his applications for supervisory positions in the SSD due to his race. On or about August 25, 2014, Plaintiff emailed a grievance to William Marshall at Defendant HHC's Equal Employment Opportunity ("EEO") Office, alleging that Defendant Motal and Toro violated his rights as a whistleblower by, among other things, denying his promotion to Social Worker Level II because of the Aleman Email. Plaintiff further alleged that Kazaki-Maher failed to correct any of the alleged retaliatory actions taken against him.

VII. Plaintiff is Promoted to Social Worker Level II
Motal left her position as Senior Associate Director of Hospitals in the Lincoln Hospital SSD on August 26, 2014. Plaintiff's request to be promoted from Social Worker Level I to Level II was subsequently resubmitted to the human resources department in or about September 2014. Plaintiff was promoted to Social Worker Level II in October of 2014.

VIII. Plaintiff Alleges [*15]  Discrimination and Retaliation by Motal, Kazaki-Maher, and Toro
While Plaintiff's promotion to Social Worker Level II was pending, he also sought to become an LCSW. The licensure required, among other things, that Plaintiff complete a certain number of supervised hours of social work. Although supervisors at Defendant HHC are not required to provide clinical supervision for employees seeking become an LCSW, Plaintiff asked Kazaki-Maher to supervise him for the hours necessary to obtain the licensure beginning in February of 2014.
Plaintiff claims that a co-worker informed him that in July of 2014, during a meeting where Defendant Motal, Toro, and Kazaki-Maher were present, Toro "put her hand across her neck to simulate a knife cutting a neck" after another person at the meeting made an unspecified negative comment about him. (Burwell Aff. ¶ 8.) On September 12, 2014, Plaintiff emailed Dr. Mondul, Milton Nunez, the Executive Director of Lincoln Hospital, Dr. Carasa, Nadal, and Marshall alleging discrimination and retaliation by Defendant Motal, Toro, and Kazaki-Maher. Plaintiff also alleged that Kazaki-Maher claimed that she was "too busy" to meet with him to provide him the clinical [*16]  supervision he requested and sign his LCSW application forms, but that she provided similar clinical supervision to a younger Asian female social worker, Lea Kobayashi-Moore. Then, on September 21, 2014, Plaintiff emailed Dr. Carasa and requested a meeting to discuss alleged discrimination by Defendant Motal, Kazaki-Maher, and Toro. Kazaki-Maher subsequently signed Plaintiff's LCSW form on or about September 22, 2014, and noted that Plaintiff had 420 hours of client contact and that she had provided 28 hours of supervision between February 25, 2014 through September 8, 2014. Ultimately, Plaintiff did not pass the examination required to become an LCSW.
On October 1, 2014, Plaintiff again emailed Dr. Carasa and asked her to investigate alleged discrimination by Defendant Motal. Specifically, Plaintiff alleged that, by selecting Kazaki-Maher to supervise PASA, Defendant Motal discriminated against him due to his race. In the same email, Plaintiff asked to be appointed the PASA Supervisor. Then, on October 15, 2014, Plaintiff emailed Manasses Williams and William Marshall at Defendant HHC's EEO Office to amend his existing discrimination grievance against Motal, Toro, and Kazaki-Maher [*17]  to allege that Dr. Carasa also discriminated against him.

IX. Plaintiff's Request for Vacation Time is Denied, He Alleges Retaliation by Kazaki-Maher, and Files an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") Complaint Alleging Discrimination and Retaliation
On November 26, 2014, plaintiff submitted a request to Kazaki-Maher for vacation time from December 26, 2014 and December 29, 2014 through January 2, 2015. At the time Plaintiff submitted this request, the PASA team appears to have consisted only of Plaintiff, Aleman, and Annette Burwell. Kazaki-Maher denied Plaintiff's request because she had already approved Aleman's request, submitted on November 24, 2014, to take a vacation day on January 2, 2015. Plaintiff contends that he was entitled to all of the vacation time requested due to his seniority in the union. Plaintiff also avers that he told Kazaki-Maher that, in the alternative, he was willing amend his vacation request to exclude January 2, 2015, but she also denied his request with this modification. Plaintiff contends that Kazaki-Maher told him that there was "no coverage" during his requested vacation days and to "stop asking because I'm not going to [ap]prove your vacation [*18]  time." (Pl.'s Rule 56.1 Counterstatement ¶ 70.)
On December 2, 2014, Plaintiff emailed Dr. Carasa, Nadal, and Yvette Villanueva at Human Resources alleging that Kazaki-Maher denied his vacation request due to retaliation because of his prior discrimination complaints against her. On December 8, 2014, Burwell submitted a request to take December 26, 2014 as a vacation day, and Kazaki-Maher granted that request. On or about December 10, 2014, plaintiff filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") alleging racial discrimination and retaliation.

X. Plaintiff is Denied a Promotion to Social Worker Level III in the MICA Program
Although he reapplied for another Social Worker Level III position in MICA, Plaintiff did not receive another interview and alleges that Robinson informed him that the position was not available to him. On or about February 17, 2015, Robinson recommended Enid Burton-Jones, an African-American female born in 1978, for the promotion. Defendant Motal was not involved in the promotion of Burton-Jones because she left Lincoln Hospital in August of 2014.
At the time of her hiring, Burton-Jones was a Social Worker Level II in the inpatient psychiatric service [*19]  of the SSD. In recommending Burton-Jones's promotion, Robinson noted that Burton-Jones had been doing work similar to that required in the position to which she was eventually promoted. Additionally, Robinson stated that Burton-Jones was a team player, had been very helpful, and was knowledgeable of resources and the referral process. Burton-Jones obtained her MSW in 2004, four years before Plaintiff, and obtained her LMSW in 2007, about one year before Plaintiff. Plaintiff contends that Burton-Jones should not have received the promotion because she had pending disciplinary matters and write ups when she applied for and received the promotion. (Anderson Aff. ¶ 21.) Plaintiff claims that, as a shop steward, he was present during Burton-Jones' disciplinary proceedings. (Id.)

XI. Plaintiff is Reassigned From PASA, Alleges Sex Discrimination and Retaliation Against Robinson, Nadal, and Charles Johnson, and Amends His EEOC Complaint
In or about February 2015, Plaintiff learned he was being reassigned from PASA to the SSD's Inpatient Psychiatric Unit. Plaintiff was reassigned because Dr. Mondul was leaving Lincoln Hospital and PASA, and Lincoln Hospital was looking to employees working in [*20]  PASA to alleviate staff shortages in the psychiatry unit. On February 23, 2015, Plaintiff submitted a grievance to Shankar Viswanathan at HHC Labor Relations against Robinson, Nadal, and Charles Johnson, alleging that his transfer from PASA to the Inpatient Psychiatric Unit was retaliation for his prior discrimination complaints. On or about February 26, 2015, plaintiff filed an Amended EEOC charge to also allege sex discrimination. Plaintiff was reassigned from PASA to the Inpatient Psychiatric Unit effective March 6, 2015, and remained a Social Worker Level II.

XII. Plaintiff is Diagnosed with Mental Health Conditions and Requests an Accommodation
Plaintiff was diagnosed with mental health conditions involving anxiety, anger, and depression while working for Defendant HHC. Plaintiff had several outbursts at work, including an outburst that occurred in or about June 16, 2015, during which he blacked out and for which he was sent to the hospital's psychiatric unit. Plaintiff subsequently made several accommodation requests for his mental health in the form of requests for medical leave, a modified work schedule to seek mental health treatment, and a transfer out of Lincoln Hospital. [*21]  The Hospital granted Plaintiff's requests for medical leave related to his mental health issues and extended Plaintiff's leave several times. Plaintiff initially requested, and was granted, medical leave from June 23, 2015 through August 10, 2015. His leave was then extended from August 11, 2015, through September 15, 2015, again from September 16, 2015 through December 1, 2015 and, finally, from December 2, 2015 through January 31, 2016.
While he was on leave, Plaintiff met with Lincoln Hospital's EEO Officer, Nicole Phillips, and presented a letter from his treating physician in connection with his request to be transferred to another HHC facility. On or about October 13, 2015, the EEO Office denied Plaintiff's request to be transferred to another HHC facility as a reasonable accommodation. Defendants assert that Phillips determined that Plaintiff did not appear to need the transfer as a reasonable accommodation because his doctor said he was fit to return to work. Plaintiff avers that Phillips failed to inquire why Plaintiff would need a transfer to another HHC facility as a reasonable accommodation and that HHC failed to confirm that Phillips understood that she was required to [*22]  undertake an "interactive process" to determine whether Plaintiff's accommodation request would result in undue hardship for Defendant HHC.
Plaintiff was medically cleared to return to work on January 4, 2016. On or about February 10, 2016, Plaintiff requested a modified work schedule in order to attend psychotherapy appointments each week. On or about February 18, 2016, the EEO Office granted Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation request for a modified work schedule.

XIII. Plaintiff's Application for a Senior Addiction Counselor Level I in the SBIRT Program is Denied
In the fall of 2016, Plaintiff interviewed for a position as a Senior Addiction Counselor Level I with the Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment ("SBIRT") Program. The Senior Addiction Counselor Level I would supervise two addiction counselors in the SBIRT Program, which was then organized in the Emergency Services Department.3 The Senior Addiction Counselor Level I position did not require an LMSW credential or any particular educational degree. However, the job posting established some minimum qualifications, including "Bilingual Skills (Spanish) Required." Defendants contend that, because it is often difficult [*23]  to have a translator in the emergency room, it was important that the hired candidate speak Spanish to adequately service the Spanish-speaking patient population at Lincoln Hospital. Plaintiff does not speak Spanish. Although he lacked the requisite language skills, Plaintiff was interviewed for the position because he was already employed at Lincoln Hospital as a social worker. Plaintiff attended two interviews for the position. Based on Plaintiff's interviews and the absence of Spanish-speaking proficiency, Plaintiff was not considered a viable candidate.
On or about November 16, 2016, Marie Holness-Flemming, an African-American female born in 1957, recommended Dilicio Acosta, who is bilingual, for the position of Senior Addiction Counselor Level I following an interview. Acosta subsequently declined the position. On or about January 10, 2017, Holness-Flemming recommended Mirta Reyes, who also speaks Spanish, for the position following her interview. Reyes also declined the position.
Plaintiff submitted his resignation from Lincoln Hospital in or about July 21, 2017 and, on August 1, 2017, he began his employment at Community Life as a Clinical Coordinator. The Senior Addiction Counselor [*24]  Level I was re-posted on July 24, 2017 with the same Spanish-language fluency requirements. On or about July 24, 2017, Holness-Flemming recommended Yesenia Cosme, a Hispanic female born in 1974, for the position following her interview. Holness-Flemming recommended Cosme for the position of Senior Addiction Counselor Level I because of her qualifications, including over 10 years of CASAC experience and her ability to speak Spanish fluently.

XIV. Plaintiff Alleges That Lincoln Hospital Has a Practice of Discriminating Against African-American Male Social Workers
Plaintiff contends that there was a wide-spread policy of not hiring or promoting African-American males at Lincoln Hospital. To start, Plaintiff claims that no African-American male supervisors have been employed by the Lincoln Hospital SSD since at least 2008. (See Doc. No. 183 ("Pl.'s Opp'n. Br.") 13.) Plaintiff also contends that he began to notice a decline in the number of African-American male social workers in 2011, at around the same time Defendant Motal began working at Lincoln Hospital. (Anderson Aff. ¶ 11.) He avers that three African-American male social workers—Richard Rice, Harry Artist, and Thomas St. Augustine—left [*25]  Lincoln Hospital between 2011 and 2015. (Id.) He claims that Rice, an LCSW, was terminated by Defendant Motal after he was unable to work an additional shift to cover for a co-worker. (Id. ¶ 12.) He also asserts that "Artist LMSW resigned in 2017,4 after being denied promotions at Lincoln Hospital." (Id. ¶ 13.) Plaintiff claims that Artist worked at Lincoln Hospital for 12 years as a Social Worker Level I and was never promoted to Social Worker Level II despite repeated attempts. (Id.) He avers that Defendant Motal terminated St. Augustine, another LMSW, because he purchased tickets for the office lottery pool, a practice that he had participated in long before Defendant Motal began working at Lincoln Hospital. (Id. ¶ 14.) Plaintiff asserts that, out of the approximately 70 to 80 social workers at Lincoln Hospital, he was the only African-American male social worker employed there in 2015. (Id. ¶ 12.)
Plaintiff also claims he observed that a Caucasian female, who was also a social worker at Lincoln Hospital,5 was treated more favorably than the African-American male social workers employed at Lincoln Hospital. Plaintiff avers that the female "appeared to come to work under the influence [*26]  of alcohol and controlled substances" and "frequently had blood shot watery eyes, slurred speech and an unsteady gait." (Id. ¶ 15.) Plaintiff explains that "this social worker was given multiple chances to improve and was ultimately allowed to resign." (Id.) In contrast, he claims that "African-American males were not provided with additional chances to improve before [Defendant] Motal terminated their employment." (Id.)
Plaintiff also contends that he knew of three African-American male social workers—David Mathews, Jerry Glosser, and Andre Smith—who were not hired for positions at Lincoln Hospital between 2012 and 2015. Mathews was not hired for a PASA social worker position in 2012 and 2013, Glosser was not hired as a PASA social worker in 2012, and Smith was not hired as a MICA supervisor in 2015. (Id. ¶ 16.) Plaintiff also claims he was informed that Defendant Motal made disparaging comments about Mathews, Glosser, and Smith and stated that she "did not believe anything Mathews said during [his] interview." (Id.) Plaintiff concludes that, "[t]he decrease in the number of African-American males in the social work department and the failure to hire any more, indicates to me that [*27]  African-American males were not treated fairly by the social work department at Lincoln Hospital." (Id. ¶ 17.)

XV. Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment
Defendants now move for summary judgment and seek to dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint ("SAC") in its entirety. The SAC alleges the following causes of action: discrimination due to race/color and sex under Title VII only against Defendant HHC (Counts I, II, and III); discrimination due to race/color, sex, and age under the New York City Human Rights Law ("NYCHRL") against both Defendants (Counts V, VI, VII, VIII); retaliation under Title VII against Defendant HHC (Count IV); retaliation against both Defendants under the NYCHRL (Count X); discrimination under the NYCHRL on the basis of disability against Defendant HHC (Count XI); and hostile work environment against Defendant HHC under the NYCHRL (Counts V, VI, VII, VIII). For the reasons set forth below, I respectfully recommend that Defendants' Motion be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.

DISCUSSION

I. Legal Standard Governing Summary Judgment Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56
Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court may grant summary judgment when "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled [*28]  to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "The movant bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute of fact, and, to award summary judgment, the court must be able to find 'after drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of a non-movant' that 'no reasonable trier of fact could find in favor of that party.'"

Ed. 2d 202 (1986); then quoting Heublein, Inc. v. United States, 996 F.2d 1455, 1461 (2d Cir. 1993)); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986) (explaining that the moving party is entitled to summary judgment where the "nonmoving party has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with respect to which she has the burden of proof"). "In evaluating whether the parties have met their respective burdens, this Court 'examine[s] the record as a whole, just as a jury would, to determine whether a jury could reasonably find an invidious discriminatory purpose on the part of an employer.'" Sealy v. Hertz Corp., 688 F. Supp. 2d 247, 254 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (alteration in original) (quoting Byrnie v. Town of Cromwell, Board of Education, 243 F.3d 93, 102 (2d Cir. 2001), superseded on other grounds by Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)).
To receive consideration, evidence submitted in support of or in opposition to a motion for summary judgment must be admissible at trial. See Santos v. Murdock, 243 F.3d 681, 683 (2d Cir. 2001) ("Affidavits submitted to defeat summary judgment must be admissible themselves or must contain evidence that will be [*29]  presented in an admissible form at trial." (citing Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323-24); see also Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corp. v. Esprit De Corp., 769 F.2d 919, 924 (2d Cir. 1985) (plaintiff could not rely on inadmissible hearsay to oppose motion for summary judgment); Davis-Bell v. Columbia Univ., 851 F. Supp. 2d 650, 675 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (comment made to plaintiff by non-party that the non-party and plaintiff's employer "did not like blacks" was inadmissible hearsay). A non-moving party cannot create a material issue of fact to defeat summary judgment by making conclusory statements that are unsupported by admissible evidence. See Johnson v. Killian, 680 F.3d 234, 236 (2d Cir. 2012).
When determining whether a grant of summary judgment is appropriate, the court's decision should not hinge on whether it "'believes that the plaintiff will be unable to meet his or her burden of persuasion at trial.'" Walder v. White Plains Bd. of Educ., 738 F. Supp. 2d 483, 493 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (alteration in original) (quoting Danzer v. Norden Sys., Inc., 151 F.3d 50, 54 (2d Cir. 1998)). Instead, the court must determine whether there is such a "'lack of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position" or evidence that is "'so overwhelmingly tilted in one direction that any contrary finding would constitute clear error.'" Id. It is well settled that "[c]redibility assessments, choices between conflicting versions of the events, and the weighing of evidence are matters for the jury, not for the court on a motion for summary judgment." Curry v. City of Syracuse, 316 F.3d 324, 333 (2d Cir. 2003) (alteration in original) (quoting [*30]  Fischl v. Armitage, 128 F.3d 50, 55-56 (2d Cir. 1997)).
In the context of employment discrimination lawsuits, courts must be "especially cautious" in granting summary judgment "because the employer's intent is often at issue and careful scrutiny may reveal circumstantial evidence supporting an inference of discrimination." Belfi v. Prendergast, 191 F.3d 129, 135 (2d Cir. 1999) (first citing Chertkova v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., 92 F.3d 81, 87 (2d Cir. 1996); then citing Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., Ltd. Partnership, 22 F.3d 1219, 1224 (2d Cir. 1994)), abrogated on other grounds as recognized by Burniche v. General Elec. Automation Servs., Inc., 306 F. Supp. 2d 233, 241 (N.D.N.Y. 2004).

II. Discrimination Claims Under Title VII and the NYCHRL

a. Burdens of Proof
Discrimination claims under Title VII are analyzed pursuant to the three-step burden-shifting paradigm established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See, e.g., Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 42 (2d Cir. 2000). Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, Plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. See McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802; see also St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993), overruled in part on other grounds by Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 169-70, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009). The elements of a prima facie case vary depending on the nature of the claim (e.g., failure to promote and disparate treatment).
After a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to offer some legitimate, non-discriminatory reason to justify its actions. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802. "This burden is one of production, not persuasion; it can involve no credibility assessment." Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 142, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If met, the burden shifts back [*31]  to the plaintiff to offer proof that would enable a reasonable fact finder to conclude that the defendant's proffered reason was a pretext for discrimination. See id. at 143; see also Schnabel v. Abramson, 232 F.3d 83, 88-90 (2d Cir. 2000). Plaintiff bears the "final and ultimate burden . . . to establish that the Defendants' reasons are in fact pretext for unlawful discrimination." Hofmann v. Schiavone Contracting Corp., 630 F. App'x 36, 39 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As such, at the final step of the McDonnell Douglas framework, a plaintiff must meet a higher burden than required in making his prima facie case and assert more "sharpened and focused" facts to defeat the defendant's facially neutral reasons justifying its actions. Meiri v. Dacon, 759 F.2d 989, 995 (2d Cir. 1985); see Brown v. City of New York, No. 10 Civ. 3104 (PKC), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137880, 2011 WL 6003921, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 30, 2011), aff'd, 512 F. App'x 29 (2d Cir. 2013). "At that point, the governing standard is simply whether the evidence, taken as a whole, is sufficient to support a reasonable inference that prohibited discrimination occurred." Zakre v. Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, 396 F. Supp. 2d 483, 509 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (citing James v. New York Racing Ass'n., 233 F.3d 149, 156 (2d Cir. 2000)). Individuals are not liable for claims brought under Title VII. See Patterson v. County of Oneida, N.Y., 375 F.3d 206, 221 (2d Cir. 2004).
Although discrimination claims under the NYCHRL are also analyzed pursuant to the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, such claims are also more liberally construed. See Ya-Chen Chen v. City Univ. of N.Y., 805 F.3d 59, 75 (2d Cir. 2015). "[T]he NYCHRL expands the definition of discrimination beyond 'conduct [that] is 'tangible' (like hiring or [*32]  firing),' . . . to encompass all allegations that a plaintiff is treated differently based on protected status." Kerman-Mastour v. Financial Indus. Regulatory Auth., Inc., 814 F. Supp. 2d 355, 366 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (quoting Williams v. New York City Hous. Auth., 61 A.D.3d 62, 872 N.Y.S.2d 27, 40 (1st Dep't 2009)). Accordingly, the court must analyze these claims separately and independently from the Title VII claims, "construing the NYCHRL's provisions broadly in favor of discrimination plaintiffs, to the extent that such a construction is reasonably possible." Mihalik v. Credit Agricole Cheuvreux N. Am., Inc., 715 F.3d 102, 109 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under the NYCHRL, the plaintiff bears "a lesser burden of showing only that Defendants' actions were based, in part, on discrimination." Allen v. A.R.E.B.A. Casriel, Inc., No. 15 Civ. 9965 (KPF), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147491, 2017 WL 4046127, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 12, 2017). To show discrimination under the NYCHRL, a plaintiff must demonstrate that his employer treated him "'less well than other similarly situated employees, at least in part for discriminatory reasons.'" In re New York City Dep't of Educ., No. 15-CV-7150 (AJN), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54430, 2019 WL 1433163, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2019) (quoting E.E.O.C. v. Bloomberg L.P., 967 F. Supp. 2d 816, 836 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)).
"However, the NYCHRL is not a 'general civility code.'" 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54430, [WL] at *13 (Williams, 872 N.Y.S.2d at 40). As such, a district court may grant summary judgment on an NYCHRL claim "if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact regarding plaintiff's claim and the employer's affirmative defense." Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 112 (first citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); then citing Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323-24). To the extent a plaintiff states a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII, he necessarily states one under the NYCHRL. Taylor v. City of New York, 207 F. Supp. 3d 293, 2016 WL 4768829, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). Unlike Title [*33]  VII, individuals may be held individually liable under the NYCHRL. See Schaper v. Bronx Lebanon Hosp. Ctr., 408 F. Supp. 3d 379, 395 (S.D.N.Y. 2019).

b. Bases for Discrimination
To state a discrimination claim, a plaintiff must first show that he or she is a member of a protected class due to a protected characteristic, such as color/race, sex, and/or age. Here, Plaintiff asserts two theories of discrimination. The first is that he was discriminated against because of a discrete characteristic, his race/color, sex, or age. Under this theory, the court evaluates whether any of the plaintiff's protected characteristics, considered individually, may have motivated the defendants to discriminate against plaintiff. Thus, under the traditional framework, the court will evaluate Plaintiff's claims by making three separate inquiries: "Was Plaintiff discriminated against because he is 'dark skinned' and African-American?"; "Was Plaintiff discriminated against because he is male?"; and "Was Plaintiff discriminated against because of his age?"
Plaintiff's second theory of discrimination is that he was subject to "intersectional discrimination" because he is an African-American male. Legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw is credited with introducing the concept of intersectionality [*34]  to the public discourse in her 1989 law review article, Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics. University of Chicago Legal Forum: Vol. 1989: Iss. 1, Article 8, available at https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&context=uclf. A plaintiff states an intersectional discrimination claim when he or she alleges discrimination on the basis of two protected characteristics (such as sex and race) and shows that the discrimination he or she experienced is attributable, at least in part, to the combination of those protected characteristics. See Lam v. University of Hawaii, 40 F.3d 1551, 1562 (9th Cir. 1994), as amended (Nov. 21, 1994), as amended (Dec. 14, 1994) ("Rather than aiding the decisional process, the attempt to bisect a person's identity at the intersection of race and sex often distorts or ignores the particular nature of their experiences."). As explained by the Second Circuit, individual bases of discrimination may be analyzed together where the plaintiff shares some, but not all, protected characteristics with other employees who have been treated favorably by their employer or with individuals whose discriminatory [*35]  conduct is at issue. See Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 109 (2d Cir. 2010) ("[A] plaintiff's discrimination claims may not be defeated on a motion for summary judgment based merely on the fact that certain members of a protected class are not subject to discrimination, while another subset is discriminated against based on a protected characteristic shared by both subsets."); see also Craig v. Yale Univ. Sch. of Med., 838 F. Supp. 2d 4, 9 (D. Conn. 2011) (acknowledging, at the motion to dismiss stage, that an "'intersectional' or 'race plus' claim of discrimination against black males . . . can exist even without proof of discrimination against African—American women or against white males."); EEOC Enforcement Guidance on National Origin Discrimination, EEOC.GOV (Nov. 18, 2016), https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/national-origin-guidance.cfm#_ftnref35 ("Title VII . . . prohibits 'intersectional' discrimination, which occurs when someone is discriminated against because of the combination of two or more protected bases (e.g. national origin and race)."); Rachel Kahn Best et al., Multiple Disadvantages: An Empirical Test of Intersectionality Theory in EEO Litigation, 45 Law & Soc'y Rev. 991, 994 (2011) (noting that "[e]mployers . . . hold different stereotypes about black men and black women").
Here, Plaintiff asserts that he was discriminated [*36]  against because he is an "African-American male." (Pl.'s Opp'n. Br. 8-9.) Although Plaintiff did not expressly assert that he intended to pursue a theory of intersectional discrimination in his Second Amended Complaint ("SAC"), he is, nevertheless, able to assert this theory now because the SAC includes all of his individual bases for discrimination. Gorzynski, 596 F.3d at 109-10. As such, this Court will evaluate Plaintiff's claims both individually, based upon his color/race, sex, or age, as applicable, and as an "African-American male."6

c. Plaintiff's Failure to Promote Claims
Plaintiff claims he was denied several promotion opportunities due to his race/color, sex, and/or status as an African-American male under Title VII. To establish a prima facie case for discriminatory failure to promote under Title VII, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he: (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (3) was rejected for the position; and (4) either the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants having the plaintiff's qualifications or the adverse employment decision occurred [*37]  under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. See Aulicino v. New York City Dep't of Homeless Servs., 580 F.3d 73, 80 (2d Cir. 2009).
With respect to the second element of his prima facie case, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: the position sought existed during the time in question; he applied for the position; and had the basic skills required to perform the job. See Slattery v. Swiss Reinsurance Am. Corp., 248 F.3d 87, 92 (2d Cir. 2001), as amended (June 6, 2001) (a plaintiff must demonstrate that he possesses the basic skills required to perform the job sought); Meucci v. City of Hartford, No. 3:11cv766 (JBA), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33643,2013 WL 951722, at *5 (D. Conn. Mar. 12, 2013) (granting summary judgment on failure to promote claim where the position sought by plaintiff did not exist). The requirement that the plaintiff must have applied for the position at issue "'cannot be established merely with evidence that a plaintiff generally requested promotion consideration.'" McCalla v. City of New York, No. 15 Civ. 8002 (LAK) (AJP), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130040, 2017 WL 3601182, at *41 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 14, 2017) (quoting Petrosino v. Bell Atl., 385 F.3d 210, 227 (2d Cir. 2004)), adopted by 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 156161, 2017 WL 4277182 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 22, 2017). However, a plaintiff's failure to apply for the position may be excused so long as he "can 'demonstrate that (1) the vacancy at issue was not posted, and (2) the employee either had (a) no knowledge of the vacancy before it was filled or (b) attempted to apply for it through informal procedures endorsed by the employer.'" Id. (quoting Petrosino, 385 F.3d at 227). To establish the fourth element of his prima facie case, [*38]  the plaintiff need only show that he was denied the position sought and an individual outside of his protected class was hired instead. See Feliciano v. City of New York, No. 14 CIV. 6751 (PAE), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92623, 2015 WL 4393163, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 15, 2015) (first citing Zimmermann v. Assocs. First Capital Corp., 251 F.3d 376, 381 (2d Cir. 2001); then citing Soderberg v. Gunther Int'l, Inc., 124 F. App'x 30, 31 (2d. Cir. 2005) (summary order)).
If the employer provides a non-discriminatory reason for choosing the successful candidate over the plaintiff, the plaintiff generally must provide additional evidence, beyond the fact that the successful candidate was outside of the plaintiff's protected class, to create a material issue of fact and avoid summary judgment. See McCalla, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130040, 2017 WL 3601182, at *46. But if the plaintiff can point to facts demonstrating that the plaintiff was patently more qualified for the job than the successful candidate, summary judgment is inappropriate. However, the plaintiff's evidence of being more qualified than the successful candidate must be concrete, not speculative. See Lue v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., No. 16-CV-3207 (AJN), 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50749, 2018 WL 1583295, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2018) (plaintiff, an African-American female, failed to assert a failure to promote claim where she did not present evidence, beyond mere speculation, to rebut her employer's nondiscriminatory reasons for not promoting her), aff'd, 768 F. App'x 7 (2d Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 388, 205 L. Ed. 2d 218 (2019); Yu v. New York City Hous. Dev. Corp. (HDC), No. 07 Civ. 5541 (GBD) (MHD), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59759, 2011 WL 2326892, at *38 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 2011) (granting summary judgment and dismissing plaintiff's failure to promote claim where plaintiff's claim that he was more qualified [*39]  than the applicant selected for the position was "entirely conclusory and unsupported by any competent evidence"), adopted sub nom. Yu v. New York City Hous. Dev. Corp., No. 07 Civ. 5541 (GBD), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59702, 2011 WL 2183181 (S.D.N.Y. June 3, 2011), aff'd, 494 F. App'x 122 (2d Cir. 2012).
A plaintiff's subjective assessment of his qualifications is insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether an employer's proffered reason for selecting the successful candidate was pretext for discrimination. See Concepcion v. City of New York, No. 15 Civ. 2156 (AJP), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11352, 2016 WL 386099, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 29, 2016) (first citing Chenette v. Kenneth Cole Prods., Inc., 345 F. App'x 615, 619 (2d Cir. 2009); then citing Byrnie, 243 F.3d at 103) (plaintiff failed to demonstrate that defendant's decision not to hire her was pretextual where the candidates who were promoted either had more experience than plaintiff or performed better than her in their interviews and had more advanced degrees and she proffered no additional evidence of pretext), aff'd, 693 F. App'x 31 (2d Cir. 2017); see also Patel v. City of New York, No. 12-CV-6312 (LAP), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153526, 2016 WL 6820943, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2016) ("Where the employee selected for a position is 'eminently qualified,' the Court will grant summary judgment against a plaintiff claiming discriminatory failure to promote notwithstanding supported allegations that the selected employees were 'less academically qualified [and possessed] less professional experience' than the plaintiff."(quoting Gupta v. New York City Sch. Constr. Auth., 305 Fed. Appx. 687, 689 (2d Cir. 2008)), aff'd, 699 F. App'x 67 (2d Cir. 2017). "The law does not protect employees from their employer's unwise decisions or mistakes; it is not the Court's role to [*40]  second-guess an employer's business decisions, even if they are unwise or premised on a mistaken assessment of the job candidates' relative qualifications. See Lue, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50749, 2018 WL 1583295, at *8. In other words, to survive summary judgment, there must be evidence that the decision not to hire the plaintiff was infected by discriminatory animus, and was not just a bad or mistaken decision. See Bohorquez v. City of New York, No. 11 Civ. 3017 (AJN), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190733, 2013 WL 11327030, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 14, 2013) ("As a legal matter, it is well settled that a nondiscriminatory reason for an employment action does not become illegitimate simply because it is mistaken.").
Plaintiff also asserts discriminatory failure to promote claims under the NYCHRL on the basis of his color/race, sex, age, and/or status as an African-American male. Courts in this Circuit typically employ the same shifting burdens test used to analyze Title VII failure to promote claims to evaluate NYCHRL failure to promote claims, while also keeping "the NYCHRL's more liberal standards in mind." Davis-Bell, 851 F. Supp. 2d at 679; see also Ellison v. Chartis Claims, Inc., 53 Misc. 3d 1203[A], 46 N.Y.S.3d 474, 2016 NY Slip Op 51336[U] [Sup. Ct. Kings Cty. 2016] (evaluating NYCHRL failure to promote claims), aff'd, 178 A.D.3d 665, 115 N.Y.S.3d 53 (2nd Dep't 2019).
For the reasons discussed below, the undersigned respectfully recommends that summary judgment be granted under both Title VII and the NYCHRL with respect to Plaintiff's failure to promote claims arising from Defendants' [*41]  refusal to promote him to: PASA Supervisor; Social Worker Level III in MICA in 2014; and Senior Addiction Counselor Level I in the SBIRT Program. Summary judgment should also be granted with respect to Plaintiff's failure to promote claim arising from Defendants' refusal to hire him for the Social Worker Level III position in the MCU under Title VII only. Summary judgment should be denied with respect to Plaintiff's claim that Defendants' refused to hire him for the Social Worker Level III position in MICA in 2015.
i. Promotion to PASA Supervisor
Plaintiff's claim that he was discriminatorily denied promotion to PASA Supervisor fails at the outset because he has not met his initial burden of showing that a standalone PASA Supervisor position existed. Not only did Defendant HHC not seek candidates to fill the position of PASA Supervisor, but the evidence shows that the responsibility of supervising PASA was delegated to existing supervisors, such as Esanbor and Kazaki-Maher, who were already supervising other programs. It is well settled that "[w]here 'duties [are] delegated to other[s],' and no applicants are sought, no failure to promote claim exists." Blake v. Bronx Lebanon Hosp. Ctr., No. 02 CIV. 3827 (DAB), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75770, 2007 WL 2981465, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2007) (alteration in original) (quoting [*42]  Holt v. KMI-Continental, Inc., 95 F.3d 123, 129 (2d Cir. 1996)); see also Meucci, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33643, 2013 WL 951722, at *5. Accordingly, summary judgment should be granted with respect to this claim under both Title VII and the NYCHRL.
ii. Promotion to Social Worker Level III in the MCU
Next, Plaintiff asserts a failure to promote claim in connection with Defendants' refusal to promote him to a Social Worker Level III in the MCU and promoting Erickson, an African-American female almost 20 years younger than him, instead. Plaintiff applied for the MCU position in or about January 2014. Defendant Motal7 forwarded his application to Hill, an African-American female four years older than Plaintiff, for consideration. Hill interviewed Plaintiff and Erickson for the position, but ultimately Erickson was hired.
Plaintiff has demonstrated a prima facie case of discrimination insofar as he is a member of a protected group based on his sex and his intersectional status as an African-American male; applied for the job and met the minimal qualifications indicated in the job posting; was rejected for the position; and Defendants hired Erickson, a younger female, instead of him. See Aulicino, 580 F.3d at 80.
Defendants contend that Erickson was the best qualified candidate because she was the only applicant who had mobile crisis experience, [*43]  had a track record of positive performance working for Hill for a year prior to the promotion decision, and performed well during the interview. Hill explained that she wanted the person hired for the position to have mobile crisis experience because the new hire would be spending approximately 10 percent of the time "working in the field providing services to patients." (Hill Aff. ¶ 5.) These are legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for the promotion decision.
The burden thus falls back on Plaintiff to show, for purposes of his Title VII claim, evidence that his gender or status as an African-American male were motivating factors for the decision or, for purposes of his NYCHRL claim, that his gender, age or status as an African-American male were a factor in the decision. Plaintiff attempts to meet this burden by claiming that the Defendant's asserted reasons for selecting Erickson over him are pretextual. First, he points out that lack of mobile crisis experience, which was not a requirement set forth in the job description, was not a basis to deny him the position because he had approximately seven years of such experience from working at Bridge Bronx ACT and he informed Hill about [*44]  this experience during his interview. (Anderson Aff. ¶ 19; see also Anderson Dep. Tr. 87:14-88:02.) Hill attests that plaintiff "did not provide any information [during the interview] indicating that he had mobile crisis experience" and that she "did not consider plaintiff's employment at Bridge Bronx ACT to be mobile crisis experience." (Hill Aff. ¶¶ 9-10.) Thus, there are disputes of fact as to whether Plaintiff had mobile crisis experience, whether he informed Hill of that experience, and whether Hill misjudged or disregarded Plaintiff's experience. These disputes create an issue of fact as to whether Defendants' reliance on Erickson's mobile crisis experience was a pretext for discrimination. See Zakre v. Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, 396 F. Supp. 2d 483, 509 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (when analyzing a Title VII claim, "'an employer's disregard or misjudgment of a plaintiff's job qualifications may undermine the credibility of an employer's stated justification for an employment decision,' suggesting pretext" (quoting Byrnie, 243 F.3d at 103)).
Plaintiff also contends that Defendants violated a policy of giving preference to internal candidates by choosing Erickson over him, as Erickson technically worked through a third-party contractor until she was selected for the position. (See Doc. [*45]  No. 180-8 ("Marrero Dep. Tr.") 90:12-91:24 (discussing policy).) Courts in this District have held that although an employer's failure to follow internal procedures alone is insufficient to create an inference of discrimination to support a plaintiff's prima facie case, such failure may evidence pretext at the third step of the McDonnell Douglas framework. See Petrovits v. New York City Transit Auth., No. 95 CIV. 9872 (DAB), 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3426, 2002 WL 338369, at *7-8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 4, 2002) (plaintiff's qualifications, that were equal to or better than those of the candidate selected, and defendant employer's alleged failure to follow internal Equal Employment Opportunity policies gave rise to a material issue of fact precluding summary judgment on plaintiff's failure to promote claim under Title VII (first citing Shumway v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 118 F.3d 60, 63 (2d Cir. 1997); then citing Gibbs v. Consolidated Edison of New York, Inc., 714 F. Supp. 85, 92 (S.D.N.Y.1989); then citing Stern v. Trustees of Columbia Univ., 131 F.3d 305, 313 (2d Cir. 1997)); see also Bagley v. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., No. 10 Civ. 1592 (PGG), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97045, 2012 WL 2866266, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. July 12, 2012) (collecting cases).
Plaintiff's posits that, had he been credited for his mobile crisis experience, he was equally or, given his CASAC certification, more qualified for the position than Erickson. Plaintiff also contends that, had Defendants followed their policy preferring internal candidates, he would have been selected. Thus, he asserts that Defendants' failure to follow policy bolsters his claim of pretext.
Notably, Plaintiff does not address the other reasons [*46]  cited by Defendants for selecting Erickson over him. Plaintiff does not dispute that Erickson had been working in the MCU under Hill for a year prior to the decision, whereas it does not appear that he worked directly for Hill such that she would have been familiar with his performance. He also does not contend that Erickson was a poor performer. Nor does he dispute Defendants' contention that Erickson performed well in her interview, which is a lawful basis on which to make a hiring decision between two qualified candidates. See Tucker v. New York City, 376 F. App'x 100, 102 (2d Cir. 2010).
It is a close call whether the evidence Plaintiff proffers creates a material issues of fact precluding summary judgment because Plaintiff points to evidence showing that the main justification for the decision to hire Erickson was pretextual, but offers no evidence showing the other reasons for the decision were pretextual. He points to an internal policy of preferring internal candidates, but offers no explanation as to how that policy has been applied to candidates who have worked at the hospital through third-party contractors. He claims that other African-American men were denied promotion but offers no details regarding their applications for promotion [*47]  or qualifications compared to the successful applicants. Nor does he point to any comments by any decisionmaker that suggest animus against him based on any protected characteristic.8
In some cases, evidence of pretext alone is sufficient to infer discrimination. See Reeves, 530 U.S. at 147 ("In appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose."). However, "[a] plaintiff does not necessarily avoid summary judgment merely by establishing a prima facie case and presenting some evidence of pretext." Camblard v. Connecticut Dep't of Children and Families, 09-CV-0985 (JCH), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81634, 2011 WL 3163581 *5 (D. Conn. July 26, 2011) (citing Schnabel v. Abramson, 232 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir. 2000)). Instead, for purposes of a Title VII claim, the court must evaluate the entire record to determine whether the evidence may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated against the plaintiff. See id. (Schnabel, 232 F.3d at 90).
Under the NYCHRL, the standard is more favorable to the plaintiff. Summary judgment is appropriate if no reasonable jury could conclude either that the defendant's "reasons were pretextual," or that the defendant's stated reasons were not its sole basis for taking action, and that its [*48]  conduct was based at least "in part on discrimination." Melman v. Montefiore Med. Ctr., 98 A.D.3d 107, 127, 946 N.Y.S.2d 27, 40 (1st Dep't. 2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In other words, summary judgment is appropriate "only if the record establishes as a matter of law that 'discrimination play [ed] no role' in its actions." Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 110 n.8 (first quoting Williams, 61 A.D.3d 62, 872 N.Y.S.2d at 38, 40 n. 27; then citing Furfero v. St. John's Univ., 94 A.D.3d 695, 941 N.Y.S.2d 639, 642 (2d Dep't 2012)).
In this case, the entire record does not support Plaintiff's claims of discrimination under Title VII based on gender and his status as an African-American male. While there is a dispute as to whether Plaintiff had relevant mobile crisis experience, which could indicate that Hill's reliance on his lack of that experience is pretextual, there is no evidence rebutting Hill's explanation that her familiarity with Erickson's good work and Erickson's performance in the interview also tipped the balance in favor of Erickson. On balance, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there is insufficient evidence from which the trier of fact could conclude that Plaintiff's gender or status as an African-American male was a motivating factor in the decision to hire Erickson instead of Plaintiff for the MCU role. In light of the more lenient standard under the NYCHRL, however, when construing [*49]  the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable jury might conclude that the main reason for selecting Erickson over Plaintiff was pretextual. Therefore, I recommend that summary judgment be granted on Plaintiff's Title VII claims but denied on Plaintiff's NYCHRL claims against Defendant HHS as to this promotion.
Because Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant Motal participated in the interviewing process and approved Erickson's hire and produced a promotion form reflecting that Motal was involved in promoting Erickson, the Court finds that there is sufficient evidence from which a jury may find that Defendant Motal participated in the decision. Accordingly, I recommend that summary judgment also be denied on this claim under the NYCHRL as to Motal. See Schaper, 408 F. Supp. 3d at 395.
iii. Promotions to Social Worker Level III in the MICA Program
I next address Plaintiff's failure to promote claim in connection with Defendant's refusal to promote him to Social Worker Level III in the MICA program, first in May of 2014 and again in February of 2015. Plaintiff has satisfied his prima facie case of discrimination insofar as he is in a protected class, applied for the position in both May 2014 and February [*50]  2015, met the minimal qualifications for the Social Worker Level III position in MICA, as set forth in the job description, and was denied the position in 2014 in favor of a younger, Caucasian female and in 2015 in favor of a younger, African-American female. See Aulicino, 580 F.3d at 80. Motal was involved in the 2014 decision, but subsequently left Lincoln Hospital and was not involved in the 2015 decision.
1. Defendants Hire Horowitz in May of 2014
Horowitz, a Caucasian female almost twenty years younger than Plaintiff, received the MICA position in 2014 on the recommendation of Defendant Motal. Although she was employed by Defendant HHS, Horwitz worked at a different hospital, Woodhull Hospital, at the time she applied for the position. Defendants state that they hired Horowitz instead of Plaintiff because Horowitz had an LCSW, which Plaintiff lacked, in addition to an LMSW (which Plaintiff had). Horowitz also had eight years of relevant experience from working at Woodhull Hospital in a unit similar to MICA, and was a Social Worker Level II at the time she was hired for the Social Worker Level III position in MICA. In contrast, Plaintiff was a Social Worker Level I who had been recommended for promotion [*51]  to Social Worker Level II. The above are legitimate reasons to have selected Horowitz, shifting the burden back to Plaintiff.
Plaintiff again offers evidence of pretext. He argues that he was at least as equally qualified as Horowitz, if not more so, because he had a CASAC certification which Horwitz lacked. He also asserts that Defendants failed to follow their established policy of giving hiring preferences to qualified internal candidates. See Petrovits, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3426, 2002 WL 338369, at *7-8. According to Plaintiff, an internal candidate is one from the same hospital, not a different hospital within the HHS system. Plaintiff does not dispute that he did not have an LCSW, and indeed, admits he later failed the test to acquire this qualification. He has no evidence that reliance on this superior qualification was pretextual, and offers no evidence to suggest that the internal policy required preference of an internal candidate over an external candidate with a superior credential. Nor does Plaintiff dispute that Horowitz had relevant experience. Plaintiff offers no evidence that decisionmakers made comments indicating a bias against men, against older workers, against Plaintiff based on his race/color or against African-American [*52]  men. And, as discussed above, the evidence of allegedly discriminatory treatment of African-American men is too speculative to raise an inference of discrimination. His contention that he was more qualified is insufficient to defeat summary judgment. See Chenette, 345 F. App'x at 619; Byrnie, 243 F.3d at 103; Concepcion, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11352, 2016 WL 386099, at *14. Thus, with respect to Plaintiff's Title VII claim, construing the record as a whole and in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there is insufficient evidence from which the trier of fact could conclude that Plaintiff's gender, race, color or status as an African-American male were motivating factors in the decision to hire Erickson instead of Plaintiff for the MCU role.
Additionally, because Plaintiff's evidence of pretext does not undermine the reason proffered for selecting Horowitz over Plaintiff—her superior credential of LCSW—this evidence is also insufficient to defeat summary judgment on his claims under the NYCHRL as to this position. Ellison, 53 Misc. 3d 1203[A], 46 N.Y.S.3d 474, 2016 NY Slip Op 51336[U] (dismissing NYCHRL failure to promote claim where there was "no evidence that plaintiff was more qualified than the[] chosen candidates, who had law degrees and substantial legal training which plaintiff did not possess, and/or significantly longer claims handling experience than plaintiff" [*53]  and plaintiff failed to assert facts showing discriminatory animus). Accordingly, I recommend that Defendants' motion for summary judgment be granted as to Plaintiff's claims under Title VII and the NYCHRL as to this position.
2. Defendant HHC Hires Burton-Jones in February of 2015
Defendant HHC hired Burton-Jones, an African-American female approximately 20 years younger than Plaintiff, on the recommendation of Robinson, an African-American female also approximately 20 years younger than Plaintiff, for the MICA position in 2015. Defendant HHC asserts that it deemed Burton-Jones to be the most qualified candidate. Unlike Plaintiff, Burton-Jones already was a Social Worker Level III in in a supervisory role, whereas Plaintiff was a Social Worker Level II. Burton-Jones also obtained both her MSW and LMSW before Plaintiff acquired similar credentials. Burton-Jones was, like Plaintiff, an internal candidate. She had worked as a social worker at Lincoln Hospital for almost seven years, compared to Plaintiff's approximately four years. Both she and Plaintiff had substantial experience working with at-risk populations, but Burton-Jones also had experience similar to the job to which she was [*54]  promoted. These are legitimate reasons for selecting Burton-Jones.
Plaintiff contends that Defendant HHC's reasons for hiring Burton-Jones over him were pretextual. First he contends that Burton-Jones had an open disciplinary action against her at the time she was promoted, and that by hiring Burton-Jones, HHC circumvented its own established policy of not promoting employees who had open disciplinary actions. (Anderson Aff. ¶ 21.) Plaintiff avers that he has personal knowledge about Burton-Jones's disciplinary proceeding because he was a shop steward for the union at that time. (Id.) He claims that, unlike Burton-Jones, he had satisfactory evaluations and no open disciplinary proceedings when he applied for the MICA position and, thus, was eligible for the promotion, while Burton-Jones was not. Defendants do not address this argument in their briefing. (Doc. 170 ("Def.'s Moving Br.") 11-12; Doc. No. 189 ("Def.'s Reply Br.") 6-7.) Plaintiff also contends that when he applied for the position, he was told the position was not available to him and was not interviewed. Plaintiff suggests that this bolsters his claim of pretext, given that he met the minimum qualifications for the job.
 [*55] Here, Plaintiff's evidence of pretext is strong because it raises an inference that Burton-Jones did not, in fact, meet the Hospital's criteria for promotion—criteria it held against Plaintiff in explaining why his promotion to Social Worker Level II was cancelled or delayed. See Petrovits, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3426, 2002 WL 338369, at *7-8. Moreover, the Hospital does not deny that Plaintiff met the minimum criteria for the position. Based on the record as a whole, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, it is possible a trier of fact might conclude that the Hospital's proffered reason for hiring Burton-Jones and not Plaintiff was a pretext for discrimination under both Title VII and the NYCHRL. Accordingly, I recommend that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be denied as to Plaintiff's claims of discrimination with regard to this promotion decision.
iv. Promotion to Senior Addiction Counselor Level I Position in the SBIRT Program
The last promotion decision Plaintiff challenges is HHC's decision to deny him the position of Senior Addiction Counselor Level I in the SBIRT Program in Fall of 2016. The job posting for this position did not require any particular educational degree, only "a satisfactory equivalent combination [*56]  of education and experience." (Doc. No. 172-55.) The posting did, however, require that eligible applicants be able to speak Spanish. Defendant HCC contends that Spanish fluency was a requirement for the position because the person hired would be serving a Spanish-speaking patient population. Defendant HHC hired Cosme because she was CASAC certified and was fluent in Spanish. Other candidates offered the position also spoke Spanish.
Plaintiff has failed to make his prima facie case of discrimination under both Title VII and the NYCHRL with respect to this claim because he does not speak Spanish and was, thus, not qualified for the Senior Addiction Counselor position. See Colson v. Cablevision MFR, Inc., No. 05-cv-5639 (PGS), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18488, 2008 WL 687257, at *6 (D.N.J. Mar. 11, 2008) (plaintiff failed to make prima facie case in discriminatory failure to promote claim where she was not bilingual and "[t]here is nothing in the record that shows that the bilingual requirement was not added in the regular course of business or was a pretext for retaliation."); see also Tayac v. City of San Francisco, 203 F.3d 832 (9th Cir. 1999) (where plaintiff was not included in a list of "most qualified" candidates initially promoted, defendants provided legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for not including plaintiff on [*57]  the list, including his lack of bilingual skills); Davis v. Dep't of Educ. of New York, No. 10 CIV. 05213 (DF), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141288, 2012 WL 4713610, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2012) (although the relevant job posting did not require Spanish fluency, plaintiff failed to show that defendant's decision not to promote her to assistant principal was pretextual where defendant provided evidence showing that the schools in question had a high proportion of Spanish-speaking children); Strong v. Progressive Roofing Servs., No. 05-1023-PHX-EHC, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61675, 2007 WL 2410354, at *4 (D. Ariz. Aug. 20, 2007) (where the position that plaintiff sought required Spanish fluency, he did not raise a triable issue of fact by alleging he spoke "some" Spanish). Even if Defendant HHC's decision not to hire Plaintiff was based, in part, on discriminatory animus, Plaintiff's claim would still fail under Title VII because he was not qualified for the job and, thus, HHC would have reached the same conclusion absent a discriminatory motive. See Crews v. Trustees of Columbia Univ., 452 F. Supp. 2d 504, 529 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (collecting cases).
Plaintiff contends that he would have been able to perform the essential duties of the job without speaking Spanish because Spanish-language interpreters were often stationed in the emergency room at Lincoln Hospital, patients frequently had family members who could act as translators, and he could also use CyraCom, a telephone translation service, [*58]  to communicate with Spanish-speaking patients. This argument, however, is unpersuasive because it would be inappropriate for this Court to second-guess Defendant HHC's reasoning for requiring that eligible candidates be able to speak Spanish instead of, as Plaintiff suggests, stationing interpreters in the emergency room and allowing counselors to rely on bilingual family members and telephone translation services to communicate with patients. See Gonzalez v. City of New York, 354 F. Supp. 2d 327, 335 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) ("In determining whether an employee is 'qualified' under . . . the McDonnell Douglas analysis, a court must examine 'the criteria the employer has specified for the position.'" (quoting Williams v. R.H. Donnelley Inc., 199 F.Supp.2d 172, 177 (S.D.N.Y. 2002)). In sum, because Plaintiff does not speak Spanish, he has failed to make his prima facie case alleging discrimination and Defendant HHC is entitled to summary judgment on this failure to promote claim under both Title VII and the NYCHRL.

d. Other Allegedly Discriminatory Acts
Plaintiff asserts that he suffered various discriminatory adverse employment actions during his tenure at Lincoln Hospital. These include: the removal of his supervisory responsibilities over counselors in PASA; the cancellation/delay of his promotion to Social Worker Level II; his supervisor's [*59]  reluctance to provide training and supervision for purposes of accruing the clinical hours necessary to take the LCSW exam; denial of requested vacation time; involuntary reassignment from PASA to another program; and excessive scrutiny of his attendance.
To state a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII with respect to conditions of employment, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he: (1) is a member of a protected class; (2) was satisfactorily performing his or her job duties; (3) suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) the adverse employment action occurred in circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. See Siddiqi v. New York City Health & Hosps. Corp., 572 F. Supp. 2d 353, 367 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). "A plaintiff sustains an adverse employment action if he or she endures a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment." Vega v. Hempstead Union Free Sch. Dist., 801 F.3d 72, 85 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Messinger v. Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., 16 A.D.3d 314, 314, 792 N.Y.S.2d 56, 57 (1st Dep't 2005) (same). Such an action must rise beyond the level of merely being inconvenient or altering the plaintiff's job responsibilities. See Vega, 801 F.3d at 85. "[A] showing that the employer treated plaintiff 'less favorably than a similarly situated employee outside his protected group'—is a recognized method of raising an inference of discrimination for purposes of [*60]  making out a prima facie case." Mandell v. County of Suffolk, 316 F.3d 368, 379 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting Graham v. Long Island R.R., 230 F.3d 34, 39 (2d Cir. 2000)).
The test is more liberal under the NYCHRL and the plaintiff "need only show that her employer treated her less well than other similarly situated employees, at least in part for discriminatory reasons." E.E.O.C. v. Bloomberg L.P., 967 F. Supp. 2d 816, 836 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (alteration, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted). To prevail on a disparate treatment claim, however, a plaintiff "must show she was 'similarly situated in all material respects' to the individuals with whom she seeks to compare herself." Graham, 230 F.3d at 39 (quoting Shumway, 118 F.3d at 64). "'Ordinarily, the question whether two employees are similarly situated is a question of fact for the jury,' but 'a court can properly grant summary judgment where it is clear that no reasonable jury could find the similarly situated prong met.'" Broich v. Incorporated Vill. of Southampton, 462 F. App'x 39, 42 (2d Cir. 2012) (summary order) (internal citation omitted) (first quoting Mandell, 316 F.3d at 379; then quoting Harlen Assocs. v. Incorporated Vill. of Mineola, 273 F.3d 494, 499 n.2 (2d Cir. 2001)).
For the reasons explained below, the I respectfully recommends that summary judgment be GRANTED with respect to all of the discrimination claims listed below.
i. Removal of Supervisory Responsibilities Over PASA Addiction Counselors
Plaintiff claims Defendants discriminated against him by stripping him of his supervisory responsibilities over PASA addiction counselors. [*61]  Although Defendants deny that Plaintiff had any official supervisory responsibilities over addiction counselors in PASA, Plaintiff has submitted sufficient evidence, including affidavits from addiction counselors Aleman and Burwell, and Associate Director of Social Work Laboy, to support his assertion that he had some supervisory authority over the PASA addiction counselors. However, there is no evidence that having this authority removed impacted Plaintiff's pay or benefits or had any adverse impact on his reputation or standing within the department. Thus, even assuming there is a dispute over whether Plaintiff had some supervisory responsibilities that were removed, the removal of these duties does not constitute an adverse employment action for purposes of Title VII. See Terry v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 128, 138 (2d Cir. 2003) ("a demotion [may be] evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, [or] significantly diminished material responsibilities . . . ." (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).
Plaintiff also does not point to any similarly situated Social Worker Level I or II who was allowed to supervise addiction counselors. Thus, he has not shown he was treated less [*62]  well than a coworker for purposes of demonstrating a prima facie case of discrimination under the NYCHRL. Further, Plaintiff has not alleged any facts to suggest he was stripped of his supervisory duties on the basis of his sex, race, color, age or status as an African-American male. Thus, he has failed to state a prima facie case of discrimination under both statutes.
Even if he had met his initial burden, Defendants have articulated a legitimate business reason for their conduct—that Plaintiff sent an inappropriate email to Addiction Counselor Aleman. It is undisputed that Plaintiff emailed Aleman on March 27, 2014, criticizing Aleman's treatment of a patient. The very next day, Kazaki-Maher, Plaintiff's direct supervisor, and Toro met with Plaintiff to discuss the email, and to explain that Plaintiff should have raised the issue directly with Kazaki-Maher so that she could have discussed the issue directly with Aleman. According to Plaintiff, during the meeting, Kazaki-Maher and Toro informed Plaintiff that he should no longer supervise the PASA addiction counselors. Assuming Plaintiff's version of the meeting is true, the fact that Kazaki-Maher and Toro stripped Plaintiff of his [*63]  supervisory responsibilities the day after he emailed Aleman indicates that their decision was motivated by the fact that they disapproved of the manner in which Plaintiff communicated with Aleman. Plaintiff has provided no additional facts indicating that Kazakh-Maher and Toro did not actually disapprove of the email or had sanctioned Plaintiff communicating to Aleman in that manner. He points to no evidence of pretext. Plaintiff also proffers no evidence of comments indicating a bias against him based on sex, age, race, color, or his status as an African-American male. Absent evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude discrimination was a factor in taking away his supervisory responsibilities, Plaintiff cannot avoid summary judgment. Thus, Defendants' motion should be granted with respect to this claim under both Title VII and the NYCHRL
ii. Cancellation/Delay of Promotion to Social Worker Level II in PASA
Plaintiff claims Defendants discriminated against him by cancelling his promotion to Social Worker Level II and delaying it by nearly ten months. Defendants assert that any cancellation or delay in the promotion is not an actionable adverse employment action and, thus, Plaintiff [*64]  has failed to state a prima facie case of discrimination. However, there is evidence that the cancellation or delay in the promotion impacted consideration of Plaintiff's application for the promotion to the MCU position, insofar as Defendant cited Erickson's status as a Level II Social Worker as one way she was more qualified than Plaintiff for the position. The record also shows that he did not receive wage increases during the delay, and the delay slowed his career advancement. As such, Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded that he was harmed by the delay in his promotion. (See Anderson Dep. Tr. 111:09-112:17.)
Courts in this Circuit have held that a delay in promotion may constitute an adverse employment action where the delay causes injury, such as lost wages.9 See Tierney v. City of New York, No. 02 CIV. 2403 (RWS), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23217, 2007 WL 895133, at *25 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 20, 2007) (rejecting defendant's argument on summary judgment that "there is no valid Title VII claim to be asserted by Plaintiffs . . . because they were eventually promoted"; collecting cases); see also Rugg v. City of New York, No. 18 Civ. 9762 (LAP), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113857, 2019 WL 3242493, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. July 8, 2019) ("a promotion that eventually occurs can have been delayed for impermissible reasons"). Thus, Plaintiff has satisfied the third element of his prima facie case of discrimination.
Plaintiff's claim falters, however, with [*65]  respect to establishing the fourth element of his prima facie case because he has failed to allege sufficient facts linking the cancellation/delay of his promotion to discriminatory animus. See Mandell, 316 F.3d at 379 (noting that a plaintiff can demonstrate discriminatory animus by showing that he was treated less favorably than similarly situated employees outside his protected group). Plaintiff points to Horowitz - a younger Caucasian female who was promoted from Social Worker Level I to Social Worker Level II at around the same time his promotion was cancelled - as the sole comparator for this claim. However, the mere fact that Horowitz was promoted before Plaintiff, alone, is insufficient to demonstrate that he was treated less well than Horowitz. Indeed, and as discussed supra, Horowitz worked at a different hospital than Plaintiff when she was promoted. Additionally, Horowitz had been working for Defendant HHC for five years longer than Plaintiff when she was promoted. Because Plaintiff was ultimately promoted to Social Worker Level II in October of 2014, approximately three years after he began working at Lincoln Hospital, he was actually promoted from Social Worker Level I to Level II more quickly [*66]  than Horowitz.
Additionally, and as explained by other courts in this Circuit, under the "same actor" doctrine, when the individual who made a decision that was adverse to the plaintiff has also treated the plaintiff favorably in the past by, for example, recommending plaintiff for a promotion, it is difficult to impute a discriminatory motive to that individual in connection with the adverse action that is inconsistent with the initial decision to treat plaintiff favorably. See Hyek v. Field Support Servs., Inc., 702 F. Supp. 2d 84, 101 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) (quoting Grady v. Affiliated Cent., Inc., 130 F.3d 553, 560 (2d Cir. 1997)), as amended (Mar. 25, 2010), aff'd, 461 F. App'x 59 (2d Cir. 2012). Here, the fact that Defendant Motal recommended Plaintiff for a discretionary promotion in or about December of 2013 or January of 2014 and allegedly cancelled that promotion in or about April of 2014 - shortly after Plaintiff sent the Aleman Email - does not demonstrate discriminatory pretext. (See Doc. No. 180-42 (Human resources spreadsheet indicating that Plaintiff's promotion was cancelled in April of 2014).) Rather, at most, this sequence of events indicates that Defendant Motal cancelled Plaintiff's promotion because of the Aleman Email.
Defendants have explained that Plaintiff's promotion was delayed due to the Aleman Email. This is a legitimate basis for [*67]  delaying the promotion. Plaintiff attempts to argue that this explanation is pretextual by claiming that he was not really disciplined. Plaintiff says if he had actually been given a verbal warning or counseling, his union representative would have been invited to the meeting, and there is no dispute that the union representative was not at the meeting. (Pl.'s Rule 56.1 Counterstatement ¶ 50.) Plaintiff also points to Toro's deposition testimony in which she stated that the meeting with Plaintiff was not disciplinary in nature, but rather, was an opportunity "to hear [Plaintiff's] version [of the story] and just to give him guidance." (Doc. 180-4 ("Toro Dep. Tr.") 53:05-17). Plaintiff's argument regarding pretext fails in light of his conflicting characterizations what happened to him because of the Aleman Email. There is no dispute that Defendants disapproved of the nature and tone of Plaintiff's communication to Aleman, counseled him about it, and told him not to supervise Aleman. Defendants also told Plaintiff that the Aleman Email incident was the reason for the delay in his promotion. Absent evidence of pretext or that discrimination was a factor in the cancellation or delay in his promotion, [*68]  Plaintiff cannot avoid summary judgment. Thus, I recommend that summary judgment be granted on this claim under Title VII and the NYCHRL.
iii. Denial of Training Opportunities
Plaintiff also alleges that his supervisor, Kazaki-Maher, discriminated against him by refusing to offer him the same frequency of clinical training afforded to another younger, Asian, female PASA social worker. Defendants claim that denial of training is not an actionable adverse employment action in this case. Under Title VII, the "denial of professional training opportunities may constitute an adverse employment action, but only where an employee can show 'material harm' from the denial, 'such as a failure to promote or a loss of career advancement opportunities.'" Trachtenberg v. Department of Educ. of N.Y.C., 937 F. Supp. 2d 460, 468 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citation omitted); see also Carpenter v. City of Mount Vernon, 198 F. Supp. 3d 272, 280 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (same).
Here, Plaintiff has failed to show that Kazaki-Maher's alleged refusal to supervise him on a weekly basis caused him to suffer any material harm, such as a loss of advancement opportunities. Rather, Plaintiff concedes that Kazaki-Maher provided him with clinical supervision between February 25, 2014 through September 8, 2014 that was sufficient to qualify to take the LCSW exam. Thus, Plaintiff did not lose any [*69]  opportunity for advancement or suffer material harm. As such, Plaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case of discrimination as to this claim under Title VII. The same is true under the NYCHRL. The fact that Kazaki-Maher may have provided Kobayaski-Moore with clinical supervision on a more frequent basis than Plaintiff is insufficient to show that Kazaki-Maher treated Plaintiff less well when the frequency of the training made no difference to Plaintiff's career. See Moore v. Metro. Transp. Auth., 999 F. Supp. 2d 482, 501 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (dismissing NYCHRL discrimination claim on summary judgment where plaintiff failed to show that a five-month delay in training caused him material harm where he was denied the promotion he sought after taking the training and provided no evidence of discrimination, beyond the fact that most of the co-workers who received the training before he did were Caucasian). Nor has Plaintiff pointed to any evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude that Kazakh-Maher discriminated against him in whole or in part because of any protected characteristic. Thus, I recommend summary judgment be granted as to this claim under both Title VII and the NYCHRL.
iv. Denial of Requested Vacation Days
Next, Plaintiff contends that he was [*70]  discriminated against because Kazaki-Maher denied his requested vacation time on one occasion. He alleges that, although Kazaki-Maher told him he could not take December 26, 2014 and December 29, 2014 through January 2, 2015 off because there was "no coverage," PASA addiction counselors, Aleman and Burwell, were each permitted to take a single vacation day during that same timeframe. Additionally, Burwell's vacation request was approved after Plaintiff's request was denied. As indicated by the parties' submissions, Aleman is a Hispanic male and Burwell is an African-American female. (Shaffer Decl. 2.)
It is well settled that an employer's refusal to grant days off is not an adverse employment action because "while such actions may have made the work place unpleasant," they do not have any "attendant negative result." Gutierrez v. City of New York, 756 F. Supp. 2d 491, 508-509 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); Roff v. Low Surgical & Med. Supply, Inc., No. CV-03-3655(SJF)(JMA), 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30845, 2004 WL 5544995, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. May 11, 2004) (under Title VII, "the denial of a single vacation request, without any indication that there was an absolute prohibition against plaintiff taking any vacation time, is not a material adverse employment action"); Fridia v. Henderson, No. 99 CIV. 10749 (BSJ), 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17295, 2000 WL 1772779, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 30, 2000) (finding poor treatment by supervisors was not a materially adverse employment action under Title [*71]  VII because plaintiff could not demonstrate an attendant negative result). Thus, Plaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII.
Plaintiff's claim also fails under the NYCHRL because Plaintiff has not alleged any facts to link Kazaki-Maher's denial of his vacation request to discriminatory animus on the basis of age, race, color, gender or his status as an African-American male. All he says is that he had seniority and there was sufficient coverage for his request to be granted. However, Plaintiff asked for more days off in a row than either of his co-workers, who each requested only one day off. Additionally, both Aleman and Burwell were addiction counselors and, thus, held a different position than Plaintiff. Thus, Plaintiff does not point to disparate treatment, let alone disparate treatment infected by discriminatory animus. As such, summary judgment should be granted with respect to this claim under both Title VII and the NYCHRL.
v. Excessive Scrutiny of Attendance
Plaintiff asserts that, in June of 2015, another co-worker informed him that Milton Nunez, the Executive Director of Lincoln Hospital, identified him as being "excessively absent" and planned [*72]  to subject him to disciplinary action. (SAC ¶¶ 221-26.) Plaintiff denies having any attendance issues and appears to claim that the false allegation that he was "excessively absent" is tantamount to discrimination. Plaintiff has failed to state a discrimination claim under Title VII because he has not alleged that he suffered any adverse action as a result of his purported attendance issues. See Collymore v. City of New York, 767 F. App'x 42, 45 (2d Cir. 2019) (plaintiff's allegation that her work was scrutinized more closely than that of Caucasian employees, among other slights, was insufficient to assert an adverse action); see also Roff, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30845, 2004 WL 5544995, at *4 ("monitoring of an employee's hours does not constitute an adverse employment action"). Plaintiff's claim also fails under the NYCHRL because he has alleged no facts to show that he was treated less well than other similarly situated employees and that such treatment was motivated by discriminatory animus. Accordingly, summary judgment should be granted as to this claim under both Title VII and the NYCHRL.
vi. Involuntary Reassignment to Inpatient Psychiatry Unit
Plaintiff also contends that Defendants discriminated against him by involuntarily reassigning him to the Inpatient Psychiatric Service Unit. The Second Circuit [*73]  has held that "'a transfer is an adverse employment action if it results in a change in responsibilities so significant as to constitute a setback to the plaintiff's career.'" Kessler v. Westchester Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 461 F.3d 199, 206 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Galabya v. New York City Board of Educ., 202 F.3d 636, 641 (2d Cir. 2000), abrogated on other grounds as recognized in Davis-Garett v. Urban Outfitters, Inc., 921 F.3d 30, 43 (2d Cir. 2019). For example, a plaintiff may demonstrate an adverse action where he is "moved him from an 'elite' division, which provided prestige and opportunity for advancement, to a less prestigious unit with little opportunity for professional growth." Pacheco v. New York Presbyterian Hosp., 593 F. Supp. 2d 599, 617 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (citing de la Cruz v. New York City Human Res. Admin. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 82 F.3d 16, 21 (2d Cir. 1996)). A purely lateral transfer will generally not constitute an adverse employment action for Title VII discrimination purposes. See Simmons-Grant v. Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP, 915 F. Supp. 2d 498, 504 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).
Similarly, "'the receipt of undesirable assignments must be accompanied by a material detriment to an employee's working conditions to constitute an adverse employment action.'" Ward v. Shaddock, No. 14-CV-7660 (KMK), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106438, 2016 WL 4371752, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 11, 2016) (quoting Henry v. New York City Health & Hosp. Corp., 18 F. Supp. 3d 396, 406 (S.D.N.Y. 2014)) (collecting cases). A plaintiff's subjective "dissatisfaction with the work assigned," absent some evidence that the assignment materially worsened working conditions, "is insufficient to make out an adverse employment action." Johnson v. Morrison & Foerster LLP, No. 14-CV-428 (JMF), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24008, 2015 WL 845723, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 2015). An increased caseload may, in some instances, constitute an adverse employment action when the increase in workload is targeted toward the plaintiff and increases his [*74]  workload disproportionately to other co-workers. See Puglisi v. Town of Hempstead Sanitary Dist. No. 2, No. 11-CV-0445 (PKC), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163115, 2013 WL 6061984, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 15, 2013); cf. Duarte v. St. Barnabas Hosp., 265 F. Supp. 3d 325, 348 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (plaintiff failed to assert sufficient facts to raise a material issue of fact with respect to her claim that she had a higher caseload than her co-workers). Summary judgment is appropriate where a plaintiff provides no evidence "to show that the transfer was to an assignment that was materially less prestigious, materially less suited to his skills and expertise, or materially less conducive to career advancement." Galabya, 202 F.3d at 641.
Here, although Plaintiff has alleged that the transfer constituted a demotion because he was "forb[idden] . . . from providing substance abuse counseling and making substance abuse referral[s]," he has not alleged any facts to show that his transfer was materially less prestigious, materially less suited to his skills and expertise, or materially less conducive to his career advancement. (Pl.'s Opp'n. Br. 24.) Thus, the transfer is not an actionable adverse action. Plaintiff does not assert any facts indicating that he was treated less well than any similarly situated colleague with respect to the transfer. He also does not identify any similarly situated comparator with regard to the workload in the new unit. [*75]  Nor does he point to evidence that the transfer or his assignments in the unit were motivated in whole or in any part by discriminatory animus. As such, summary judgment should be granted on this claim under both Title VII and the NYCHRL.

III. Retaliation Claims Under Title VII and the NYCHRL
In addition to claiming that the above-described promotion decisions and other various employment actions were discriminatory, Plaintiff also contends these actions were carried out in retaliation for engaging in protected activity in violation of Title VII and the NYCHRL. To survive summary judgment on his retaliation claims under Title VII, plaintiff must submit sufficient admissible evidence to allow a trier of fact to find that: (1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) the employer was aware of that activity; (3) he suffered an adverse action; and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and that adverse action. See Kelly v. Howard I. Shapiro & Assocs. Consulting Eng'rs, P. C., 716 F.3d 10, 14 (2d Cir. 2013) (per curiam). Title VII defines protected activity as: (1) opposition to any practice made unlawful by Title VII or (2) making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in a Title VII investigation or proceeding. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). Both internal and external complaints [*76]  of discrimination constitute protected activity for purposes of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation. See Littlejohn v. City of New York, 795 F.3d 297, 316 (2d Cir. 2015); Ward, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106438, 2016 WL 4371752, at *8.
To establish an adverse employment action in the context of a Title VII retaliation claim, "a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination." Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); accord Davis-Garett v. Urban Outfitters, Inc., 921 F.3d 30, 43 (2d Cir. 2019) (explaining that "[p]rior decisions of this Circuit that limit unlawful retaliation to actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment . . . no longer represent the state of the law." (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Yet, "Title VII is not a general bad acts statute," Wimmer v. Suffolk Cty. Police Dep't, 176 F.3d 125, 135 (2d Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted), and " '[p]etty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience' do not constitute actionable retaliation." Hicks v. Baines, 593 F.3d 159, 165 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 548 U.S. at 68). "[I]n determining whether conduct amounts to an adverse employment action, the alleged acts of retaliation need to be considered both separately and in the aggregate, as even minor acts of retaliation [*77]  can be sufficiently 'substantial in gross' as to be actionable." Id. at 165 (citing Zelnik v. Fashion Inst. of Tech., 464 F.3d 217, 227 (2d Cir. 2006)).
With respect to the fourth element of a prima facie retaliation claim, "[p]roof of causation can be shown either: (1) indirectly, by showing that the protected activity was followed closely by discriminatory treatment, or through other circumstantial evidence such as disparate treatment of fellow employees who engaged in similar conduct; or (2) directly, through evidence of retaliatory animus directed against the plaintiff by the defendant." Id. at 170 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
Like discrimination claims, retaliation claims under Title VII are analyzed pursuant to the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. However, at step three, when the burden shifts back to the plaintiff, the plaintiff must show that retaliation was a "but-for" cause of the adverse action, not simply a "substantial" or "motivating" factor in the employer's decision. See University of Texas Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 352, 361-63, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013). "'But-for' causation does not . . . require proof that retaliation was the only cause of the employer's action—it is enough that the adverse action would not have occurred in the absence of the retaliatory motive." Nieblas-Love v. New York City Hous. Auth., 165 F. Supp. 3d 51, 70 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (citing Nassar, 570 U.S. at 360). This proof can include "weaknesses, [*78]  implausibilities, inconsistencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate, nonretaliatory reasons for its action" that would allow "a reasonable juror . . . [to] conclude that the explanations were a pretext for a prohibited reason." Zann Kwan v. Andalex Grp. LLC, 737 F.3d 834, 846 (2d Cir. 2013).
"Retaliation claims under . . . the City Human Rights Law are analyzed under the same burden-shifting framework set forth by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green." Malena v. Victoria's Secret Direct, LLC, 886 F. Supp. 2d 349, 361 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). However, the NYCHRL has a broader definition of protected activity than Title VII insofar as it includes: (1) opposition to any practice forbidden under the NYCHRL; (2) filing a complaint, testifying or assisting in any proceeding under the NYCHRL; (3) commencing a civil action claiming a violation of the NYCHRL; (4) assisting the NYCHR Commission or New York City Corporation Counsel in an investigation commenced pursuant to the NYCHRL; (5) requesting a reasonable accommodation under the NYCHRL; or (6) providing any information to the NYCHR Commission pursuant to the terms of a conciliation agreement. N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(7).
To state a retaliation claim under the NYCHRL, the plaintiff must [*79]  show that he or she "took an action opposing her employer's discrimination and that, as a result, the employer engaged in conduct that was reasonably likely to deter a person from engaging in such action." Mihalik, 715 F.3d 102, 112 (internal citations omitted); see also N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(7) ("It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice" for an employer to engage in acts "reasonably likely to deter a person from engaging in protected activity"). The "but-for" causation standard applicable to Title VII retaliation claims does not apply to claims brought pursuant to the NYCHRL. Instead, the plaintiff must show that "there was a causal connection between [the] protected activity and the employer's subsequent action," and that the "legitimate reason for . . . [the action] was pretextual or 'motivated at least in part by an impermissible motive.'" Russo v. New York Presbyterian Hosp., 972 F. Supp. 2d 429, 456 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (quoting Brightman v. Prison Health Serv., Inc., 970 N.Y.S.2d 789, 792, 108 A.D.3d 739, 741 (2nd Dep't 2013)). Under the NYCHRL, summary judgment on a retaliation claim is appropriate if "the record establishes as a matter of law" that discrimination or retaliation "play[ed] no role" in the defendant's actions. Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 110 n.8 (quoting Williams, 61 A.D.3d 62, 872 N.Y.S.2d 27, 38, 40 n.27).
There is no dispute that Plaintiff has satisfied the first two elements of his prima facie case of retaliation. First, he complained numerous [*80]  times from December 2013 through February 2015 about what he perceived to be discriminatory and/or retaliatory treatment. His complaints were made directly to supervisors, to Human Resources, to Labor Relations at HHC, and to the EEOC. All of these complaints constitute protected conduct for purposes of Title VII and the NYCHRL, and Defendant HHC was aware of all of them. Defendant Motal was also aware of complaints made during her tenure at HHC. The following is a list of Plaintiff's complaints in chronological order:
• In or about December 2013, Plaintiff informed Defendant Motal that, by appointing Kazaki-Maher at PASA supervisor, she discriminated against him because he is African-American.
• On January 23, 2014, Plaintiff informed Hill during his interview for the MCU Social Worker Level III position that he had been discriminated against by Defendant Motal and Dr. Mondul because he is an African-American man.
• During an interview for a Social Worker Level III position in MICA in or about May of 2014, Plaintiff informed Defendant Motal that she had discriminated against him and other African-American men.
• On or about July 28, 2014, Plaintiff met with Defendant Motal, Toro, and [*81]  Kazaki-Maher and accused Defendant Motal of discriminating against him by cancelling his promotion to Social Worker Level II.
• In May of 2014, Plaintiff interviewed for a Social Worker Level III position in MICA with Defendant Motal and Robinson. During the interview, Plaintiff informed Defendant Motal that she had discriminated against him and other African-American men.
• On or about August 11, 2014, Plaintiff submitted a grievance alleging, among other things, that Defendant Motal discriminated against him by denying his applications for supervisory positions in the SSD due to his race.
• On or about August 25, 2014, Plaintiff submitted a grievance to Defendant HHC's EEO Office, alleging that Defendant Motal and Toro violated his rights as a whistleblower by, among other things, denying his promotion to Social Worker Level II. Plaintiff further alleged that Kazaki-Maher failed to correct any of the alleged retaliatory actions taken against him.
• On September 12, 2014, Plaintiff emailed Dr. Mondul, Milton Nunez, the Executive Director of Lincoln Hospital, Dr. Carasa, Nadal, and Marshall, alleging discrimination and retaliation by Defendant Motal, Toro, and Kazaki-Maher.
• On September [*82]  21, 2014, plaintiff emailed Dr. Carasa and requested a meeting to discuss alleged discrimination by Defendant Motal, Kazaki-Maher, and Toro.
• On October 1, 2014, Plaintiff again emailed Dr. Carasa and asked her to investigate alleged discrimination by Defendant Motal because he believed he was discriminated against due to his race by not being promoted to PASA Supervisor.
• On October 15, 2014, Plaintiff emailed Manasses Williams and William Marshall at Defendant HHC's EEO Office to amend his existing discrimination grievance against Motal, Toro, and Kazaki-Maher to allege that Dr. Carasa also discriminated against him.
• On December 2, 2014, Plaintiff emailed Dr. Carasa, Nadal, and Yvette Villanueva at Human Resources alleging that Kazaki-Maher denied his vacation request due to retaliation because of his prior discrimination complaints against her.
• On or about December 10, 2014, plaintiff filed a charge with the EEOC alleging discrimination and retaliation.
• On February 23, 2015, Plaintiff submitted a grievance to Shankar Viswanathan at HHC Labor Relations against Robinson, Nadal, and Charles Johnson, alleging that his transfer from PASA to the Inpatient Psychiatric Unit was retaliation [*83]  for his prior discrimination complaints.
• On February 11, 2016, Plaintiff filed his complaint in this action.
• On August 3, 2016, Plaintiff amended his complaint to add additional defendants to this action.
There is no question that denials of promotion constitute adverse employment actions for purposes of stating a prima facie case of retaliation. These include the decisions denying Plaintiff a promotion to Social Worker III in the MCU in March of 2014, to the MICA Social Worker Level III positions in May of 2014 and February of 2015, and to the Senior Addiction Counsel Position in the SBIRT in or around November 2016. However, Defendants contend that the other actions alleged do not constitute actionable conduct for purposes of stating a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII and/or the NYCHRL. These include: relieving Plaintiff of his supervisory duties in PASA in March 2014; the cancellation/delay in his promotion to Social Worker Level II (from in or about April 2014 through October 2014); Kazaki-Maher denying him training between February of 2014 and September 2014 and vacation days he requested in December of 2014; involuntarily transferring him to the Inpatient Psychiatric [*84]  Unit in March 2015, giving him more work than others in that Unit, denying him the ability to work with the substance abuse community, and denying him a transfer out of the Unit or to another hospital within the HHC system; threating to discipline him for attendance issues; and failing to investigate his claims of discrimination.
As noted above, under both Title VII and the NYCHRL, the Court must ascertain whether the adverse action the plaintiff complains of would have dissuaded a reasonable employee in his or her position from complaining about discrimination. See Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 548 U.S. at 63-64; Mihalik, 715 F.3d 102, 112 (NYCHRL). However, the employer's action must be more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or triviality, as such things, without more are not reasonably likely to deter a person from engaging in protected activity. See Bermudez v. City of New York, 783 F. Supp. 2d 560, 582 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (for purposes of motion to dismiss, denial of sick and vacation days was likely to deter a person from engaging in protected activity); E.E.O.C. v. Bloomberg L.P., 967 F. Supp. 2d 816, 851 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (public reprimand, sitting next to plaintiff in silence for entire day, in light of circumstances and temporal connection to protected activity, could deter a person from engaging in protected activity). Although it is questionable whether some of the conduct Plaintiff points [*85]  to would be reasonably likely to deter a person from engaging in protected conduct because they are so trivial, the Court assumes that the conduct alleged constitutes adverse actions for purposes of Plaintiff's required prima facie showing of retaliation under both Title VII and the NYCHRL, in light of the law's extremely broad definition of actionable conduct.
However, both Title VII and the NYCHRL require a causal connection between the protected activity and the alleged retaliatory conduct. A causal connection can be shown when the employer action took place shortly after the employee engaged in the protected activity. The closer the temporal connection, the greater the inference of retaliation. See Hicks, 593 F.3d at 170. Here, because Plaintiff was constantly complaining about discrimination for over a year, all of the alleged retaliation took place within a sufficiently close temporal period to Plaintiff's claims to raise an inference of retaliation for purposes of Plaintiff's prima facie case of retaliation. Thus, Plaintiff has proffered sufficient evidence to state a prima facie claim of retaliation under Title VII and the NYCHRL.
The Court does not repeat the legitimate business reasons proffered [*86]  by Defendant to explain its decisions, as they are summarized above. The Court finds that Defendant has met its burden of production as to all of the alleged retaliatory acts and thus addresses (1) whether, for purposes of Title VII, Plaintiff has proffered evidence from which the trier of fact could conclude that retaliation was the but for cause of Defendants' decisions/conduct; and (2) whether, for purposes of the NYCHRL, the record establishes as a matter of law that retaliation played no role in the Defendants' actions.
Starting with the promotion decisions, Plaintiff has proffered sufficient evidence from which a trier of fact might conclude that retaliation played a role in the decisions denying Plaintiff the MCU and MICA promotions. With respect to the MCU position, there is evidence that Plaintiff complained about discrimination in the interview itself, and that Hill abruptly stopped the interview when Plaintiff raised the issue. (Pl.'s Rule 56.1 Counterstatement ¶ 137.) There is also evidence that Motal later spoke with Plaintiff and asked him whether he regretted raising the issue of discrimination in the interview. (Pl.'s Opp'n Br. 21.) This indicates that Motal disapproved of Plaintiff [*87]  raising the subject. The decision to deny Plaintiff this position also occurred shortly after Plaintiff complained about discrimination, thus the temporal proximity of Plaintiff's protected activity and the adverse decision bolsters an inference of retaliation.
Similarly, during his interview for a Social Worker Level III position in MICA in 2014, Plaintiff informed Motal that she should hire him because she allegedly discriminated against him and other African-American men. (Pl.'s Rule 56.1 Counterstatement ¶ 139.) Plaintiff was rejected for the position shortly thereafter, and was not given another opportunity to interview when an identical position became available in 2015. Furthermore, Motal's comment indicating disapproval of his raising complaints of discrimination in an interview can give rise to an inference of retaliatory motive. Thus, I recommend that summary judgment be denied as to Plaintiff's claims of retaliation under Title VII and the NYCHRL with respect to the promotion denials for the MCU and MICA positions. Summary Judgment should be granted, however, under both Title VII and the NYCHRL with respect to the PASA Supervisor Position because it did not exist and as to the SBIRT [*88]  position because Plaintiff was not qualified for the position.
Turning next to the verbal counseling Plaintiff received for the Aleman Email, the stripping of Plaintiff's supervisory duties in PASA, and the cancellation/delay in his promotion to Social Worker Level II, there is insufficient evidence from which a trier of fact could find that retaliation was the but-for cause of either action. Plaintiff complained in December 2013 and January 2014 that he had been discriminated against because of his race and status as an African-American male by not being given a PASA Supervisor position. The Aleman Email in March of 2014 was an intervening action by Plaintiff that was the basis for the verbal warning. Plaintiff on the one hand says he was not formally disciplined for the email, yet, on the other hand, says he was stripped of his supervisory responsibility over Aleman and spoken to about the Email. What is clear is that there is no evidence that Plaintiff's supervisors did not genuinely have an issue with the manner in which Plaintiff communicated with Aleman in the Email. There also is no dispute that the Aleman Email incident was a factor that caused Defendants to take away Plaintiff's [*89]  supervisory responsibilities over Aleman and the other PASA addiction counselor, and delay Plaintiff's promotion to Level II Social Worker. Notably, Plaintiff does not contest that the Hospital had a policy of not promoting employees who had recently been disciplined. Plaintiff also does not dispute that promotions from Social Worker Level I to Level II can take up to a year to complete, even without disciplinary issues. Given these facts, no jury could conclude that, but for Plaintiff's complaints about discrimination in December 2013 and January 2014, he would not have received counseling on the Aleman Email, would have been promoted to Social Worker Level II in April 2014 (or at least sooner than October 2014), and would have kept his supervisor duties in PASA. As such, summary judgment should be granted as to these claim under Title VII.
However, under the lower standard under the NYCHRL, the Court cannot conclude that the record establishes as a matter of law that retaliation played no role in the defendant's actions. The verbal counseling occurred within three months of Plaintiff's protected activity, and, as discussed above, there is evidence that Motal indicated that she thought [*90]  it was inappropriate for Plaintiff to have raised a complaint of discrimination in an interview in January 2014, which could give rise to an inference of retaliatory motive. To the extent Motal disapproved of Plaintiff's complaints, a jury might conclude retaliation also played a role in decisions she participated in. Although the fact that Motal nominated Plaintiff for the promotion at around the same time he accused her of discriminating against him by not promoting him to PASA Supervisor cuts against an inference of retaliation, the trier of fact must assess the totality of the evidence to determine whether retaliation infected the alleged discipline and delay in promotion. As such, summary judgment should be denied as to this claim under the NYCHRL.
The Court next examines the remainder of the retaliatory conduct alleged by Plaintiff. This includes: the allegation that Defendants transferred him to the Inpatient Psychiatric Unit, denied him the ability to work with the substance abuse community, gave him more work than others in the Psychiatric Unit, and refused his request to transfer out of the Psychiatric Unit or to another hospital; providing Plaintiff with less training than [*91]  provided to another PASA social worker; denying him vacation time; threatening Plaintiff with discipline for fabricated attendance issues; and failing to investigate his claims of discrimination.
The evidence proffered by Plaintiff precludes summary judgment as to the remaining conduct under Title VII. Given the frequency and breadth of Plaintiff's complaints, all of the conduct occurred within a temporally proximate time to Plaintiff's protected activity. Additionally, Plaintiff has proffered evidence that Motal disapproved of Plaintiff's complaints of discrimination. Plaintiff has also offered circumstantial evidence showing inconsistencies between Defendants' stated reasons for taking certain actions, that suggest that retaliation was the but-for cause of the conduct. As such, Plaintiff has met his burden at the third step of the McDonnell Douglas framework. For example, with respect to the denial of Plaintiff's requested vacation time, Plaintiff has alleged that, while his other co-workers were permitted to take time off during the same timeframe he requested, he was told by his supervisor, Kazaki-Mahar, that he could not take vacation because there was "no coverage" and that he [*92]  should "stop asking." (Pl.'s Rule 56.1 Counterstatement ¶ 70.) Likewise, although Kazaki-Mahar provided another PASA social worker with weekly clinical supervision, she declined to do the same for Plaintiff because she was "too busy." Moreover, Plaintiff contends that although he had satisfactory attendance, Robinson, the Associate Director in the SSD, informed him that his attendance was being scrutinized because of purported absenteeism. (SAC ¶¶ 221-26.)
With respect to Plaintiff's involuntary transfer to the Psychiatric Unit, another supervisor, Esanbor, told Plaintiff that he was transferred to the Psychiatric Unit because he was a "troublemaker." This comment could be viewed by a jury as management labeling Plaintiff a troublemaker because of his many complaints alleging discrimination and retaliation and suggesting that retaliation played a role in some of Defendants' conduct. Moreover, once Plaintiff was transferred to the Psychiatric Unit, Plaintiff claims he was assigned a higher caseload than other individuals working in the Unit. He was also expressly told by Robinson and Esanbor that he was no longer allowed to provide substance abuse counseling, the very thing that he had endeavored [*93]  to do as a social worker at Lincoln Hospital. (Anderson Aff. ¶ 32.) Although Defendants explained that Plaintiff was reassigned to the Psychiatric Unit because they "needed PASA workers to meet staff needs," the circumstantial evidence surrounding the transfer and the conditions that Plaintiff was allegedly subjected to once the transfer occurred could lead a trier of fact to conclude that the transfer would not have occurred absent a retaliatory motive. See Nieblas-Love, 165 F. Supp. 3d at 70; Zann Kwan, 737 F.3d at 846. Indeed, although Defendants represent that they specifically sought PASA workers to fulfill the need for staff in the Psychiatry Unit, it appears that Plaintiff was the only PASA worker who was actually transferred to that Unit. Finally, Plaintiff claims he was directly told by Nicole Phillips, the EEO Investigation Officer in the Human Resources Office, that she would not investigate his complaints because Plaintiff had already filed a complaint with the EEOC.
In sum, the Court finds that the incidents described above, at least in the aggregate, were of the type that could deter a reasonable person from making or supporting a charge of discrimination and Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to show a causal link between his [*94]  protected conduct and those adverse actions to satisfy his burden under Title VII. Because these acts are sufficient to state retaliation claims under Title VII, Plaintiff has also met his burden under the NYCHRL.
Accordingly, summary judgment should be granted with respect to Plaintiff's retaliation claim arising from Defendants' refusal to promote him to PASA Supervisor and to the supervisory position in the SBIRT under Title VII and the NYCHRL. Summary judgment should also be granted with respect to Plaintiff's retaliation claim arising from the delay in his promotion to Social Worker II and the removal of his supervisory responsibilities over PASA addiction counselors under Title VII. It should be denied in all other respects.

IV. Title VII and NYCHRL Hostile Work Environment Harassment Claims Against HHC
"To establish a prima facie case of hostile work environment under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he suffered unwelcome harassment; (3) he was harassed because of his membership in a protected class; and (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive work environment." [*95]  Uko-Abasi v. AmeriPath, Inc., No. 09 Civ. 3629(DAB)(RLE), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26474, 2011 WL 924894, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 25, 2011); see also Duch v. Jakubek, 588 F.3d 757, 762 (2d Cir. 2009). "This test has objective and subjective elements: the misconduct shown must be 'severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment,' and the victim must also subjectively perceive that environment to be abusive." Alfano v. Costello, 294 F.3d 365, 374 (2d Cir. 2002) (quoting Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993), overruled on other grounds by Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 548 U.S. 53, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345). To be deemed pervasive, the harassment and insults "must be 'more than episodic; they must be sufficiently continuous and concerted in order to be deemed pervasive.'" Desardouin v. City of Rochester, 708 F.3d 102, 105 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Perry v. Ethan Allen, Inc., 115 F.3d 143, 149 (2d Cir. 1997)); see also Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 67, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 91 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1986) (The "[m]ere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee would not affect the conditions of employment to a sufficient degree to violate Title VII." (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); Davis-Bell, 851 F. Supp. 2d at 671 (holding that plaintiff failed to state a hostile work environment claim where he alleged a "small number of events" that were "isolated . . . [and] occurred over a substantial period of years."). "Even if plaintiff can establish that she was exposed to an objectively and subjectively hostile work environment, she will not have a claim under Title VII unless she can also demonstrate that the hostile work environment was caused by animus towards her as [*96]  a result of her membership in a protected class." Sullivan v. Newburgh Enlarged Sch. Dist., 281 F. Supp. 2d 689, 704 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).
"While a mild, isolated incident does not make a work environment hostile, the test is whether the harassment is of such quality or quantity that a reasonable employee would find the conditions of her employment altered for the worse." Armstrong v. Metro. Transp. Auth., No. 07 Civ. 3561(DAB), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27758, 2015 WL 992737, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3, 2015) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). However, "a single act can meet the threshold if, by itself, it can and does work a transformation of the plaintiff's workplace." Alfano, 294 F.3d at 374; see also Howley v. Town of Stratford, 217 F.3d 141, 154 (2d Cir. 2000) (female firefighter sufficiently plead hostile work environment claim where she was subject to sexually explicitly verbal abuse that challenged her competence in front of a large group of co-workers, including subordinates, and created a reasonable fear she would be abandoned by her colleagues at fire scenes). In evaluating a hostile work environment claim, the Court "must look to the totality of the circumstances to determine whether an environment is 'hostile' or 'abusive,'" and should consider among the following factors: "the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an [*97]  employee's 'work performance.'" Lee v. Sony BMG Music Entertainment, Inc., No. 07 Civ. 6733, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19481, 2010 WL 743948, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3, 2010) (quoting Harris, 510 U.S. at 21).
To establish a hostile work environment under the NYCHRL, a plaintiff must show that the defendant treated him less well because of his membership in a protected class. Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 110; see also Schaper, 408 F. Supp. 3d at 398 ("The NYCHRL imposes liability for harassing conduct that results in any unequal treatment, and 'severity' and 'pervasiveness' of the conduct is germane to the issue of damages, not liability." (quoting Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 110)); Reichman v. City of New York, 179 A.D.3d 1115, 2020 N.Y. App. Div. LEXIS 595, 2020 WL 465159, at *3 (2nd Dep't 2020). However, because the NYCHRL is "not a 'general civility code,'" a showing that the plaintiff has "an overbearing or obnoxious boss" does not establish an actionable hostile work environment claim. Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 110. Moreover, where an employer treats an employee "less well" because of a protected characteristic, it "may only avoid liability . . . when the conduct complained of constitutes nothing more than 'petty slights and trivial inconveniences.'" Pryor v. Jaffe & Asher, LLP, 992 F. Supp. 2d 252, 260 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (quoting Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 110-11)); see also Bermudez, 783 F. Supp. 2d at 579; Reichman, 2020 N.Y. App. Div. LEXIS 595, 2020 WL 465159, at *3 ("'mere personality conflicts' will not suffice to establish a hostile work environment" (quoting Forrest v. Jewish Guild for the Blind, 3 N.Y.3d 295, 309, 819 N.E.2d 998, 1010, 786 N.Y.S.2d 382 (2004)).
Summary judgment is inappropriate under either standard "[w]here reasonable jurors could disagree as to whether alleged incidents would have adversely altered the working conditions of a reasonable employee [*98]  . . . ." Armstrong, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27758, 2015 WL 992737, at *2; see also Spence v. Bukofzer, No. 15 Civ. 6167 (ER), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47979, 2017 WL 1194478, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2017) (denying motion for summary judgment against African-American plaintiff's hostile work environment claim where acts included: a manager calling African-American employees "monkeys" and "slaves"; a negative evaluation; exclusion from a meeting; a false allegation that she lied; unfavorable or unsafe assignments; a demotion; salary decreases; and a refusal by her employer to investigate her allegations of discrimination).
Plaintiff claims that the following incidents and conditions give rise to his hostile work environment claim:
• He was told that "management did not like him." (Pl's. Opp'n. Br. 26.)
• Burwell informed him that Dr. Mondul stated that Plaintiff did not "fit in" and she observed Toro make a "neck cutting" gesture after someone made an unspecified negative comment about Plaintiff at a meeting where Defendant Motal, Toro, and Kazaki-Maher were present.10 (Id.)
• Defendant HHC removed Plaintiff from PASA and forbid him from working with substance abuse patients, although others were allowed to.
• Esanbor told him in front of another co-worker that he was involuntarily reassigned to the Inpatient Psychiatric Service Unit because he was a "troublemaker." (Id. [*99] )
• Defendant HHC failed to investigate Plaintiff's discrimination claims.
• Defendant HHC created a higher standard for him than for others to get promoted to a supervisory position.
To start, Plaintiff's claim that Defendant HHC failed to investigate his discrimination claims does not support his hostile work environment claim because this failure would not have altered the conditions of Plaintiff's employment. See Fincher v. Depository Tr. & Clearing Corp., 604 F.3d 712, 724 (2d Cir. 2010) ("[T]he failure to investigate did not by itself alter the terms and conditions of [Plaintiff's] employment; rather, it preserved the very circumstances that were the subject of the complaint."). Moreover, to the extent Plaintiff claims that "HHC created a higher standard for him than for others in order to get promoted to a supervisory position," this allegation does not provide a basis for a hostile work environment claim. See Jimenez v. City of New York, 605 F. Supp. 2d 485, 530 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (granting summary judgment and dismissing hostile work environment claim that was a restatement of plaintiff's discriminatory failure to promote claim); see also Armstrong v. M.T.A., 07 Civ. 3561(DAB), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27758, 2015 WL 992737, *6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3, 2015) (granting summary judgment on NYCHRL hostile environment claim; evidence proffered to show that transfer was denied for discriminatory [*100]  reasons did not constitute evidence from which a jury could conclude that plaintiffs were subjected to a continuing hostile work environment because of their sex); Wood v. Sophie Davis Sch., No. 02 Civ. 7781 HB, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11112, 2003 WL 21507579, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. June 30, 2003) ("failure to promote . . . may not stand as grounds for a hostile work environment").
After carefully considering all of the facts and circumstances giving rise to this claim, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to establish his prima facie case with respect to his hostile work environment claim under Title VII because the incidents described above were, at most, episodic rather than pervasive and Plaintiff has failed to link these incidents to discriminatory animus. See Uko-Abasi, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26474, 2011 WL 924894, at *6; Duch, 588 F.3d at 762. The result is the same under the NYCHRL because Plaintiff has not alleged facts to show that he was treated less well than his co-workers due to his membership in a protected class. Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 110; Reichman, 179 A.D.3d 1115, 2020 N.Y. App. Div. LEXIS 595, 2020 WL 465159, at *3.

V. Failure to Accommodate Disability in Violation of NYCHRL
Plaintiff's last claim is disability discrimination under the NYCHRL for failure to accommodate by granting Plaintiff a transfer. To state a prima facie case against an employer for failure to accommodate under [*101]  the NYCHRL, the employee must show that: (1) he has a disability as defined by § 8-102(16) of the NYCHRL (i.e., "any physical, medical, mental or psychological impairment"); (2) the employer knows or should have known about the employee's disability; and (3) the employee requested a reasonable accommodation that would permit them to perform the essential functions his job; and (4) the employer failed to provide reasonable accommodations that would have enabled the employee to carry out the essential functions of his job. See Sivio v. Village Care Max, No. 18 Civ. 2408 (GBD) (GWG), 436 F. Supp. 3d 778, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16729, 2020 WL 497513, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 31, 2020) (explaining that the prima facie test is identical for claims brought pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 701-796, NYSHRL, and NYCHRL); see also NYCHRL §§ 8-102(16) and 8-107(15)(a); Romanello v. Intesa Sanpaolo, S.p.A., 22 N.Y.3d 881, 885, 998 N.E.2d 1050, 1053, 976 N.Y.S.2d 426 (2013) (citing NYCHRL § 8-107(15)(a)); Watson v. Emblem Health Servs., 158 A.D.3d 179, 182, 69 N.Y.S.3d 595, 597 (1st Dep't 2018). Under the rule, a reasonable accommodation is a modification to the workplace that will allow the plaintiff to perform "the essential functions of the job at issue." McMillan v. City of New York, 711 F.3d 120, 125-26 (2d Cir. 2013); see also Lenhoff v. Getty, No. 97CIV.9458(LMM), 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9835, 2000 WL 977900, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. July 17, 2000) ("job-induced stress cannot be considered a disability under the NYSHRL or NYCHRL" (citing Daley v. Koch, 892 F.2d 212, 215 (2d Cir. 1989)); LeBlanc v. United Parcel Serv., No. 11 Civ. 6983(KPF), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50760, 2014 WL 1407706, at *17; see also Sivio, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16729, 2020 WL 497513, at *7 ("'reasonable accommodation can never involve the elimination of an essential function of a job.'" (quoting Shannon v. New York City Transit Auth., 332 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir. 2003)).
"The standard under the NYCHRL is liberal, but not boundless . . . ." LeBlanc Parcel Serv., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50760, 2014 WL 1407706, at *13. Under the NYCHRL, an employer is not required to provide [*102]  an employee "'with the specific accommodation . . . preferred' but, rather, with any 'reasonable accommodation.'" Kelly v. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., No. 15cv6309 (DLC), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43485, 2017 WL 1133433, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2017) (quoting Porter v. City of New York, 128 A.D.3d 448, 6 N.Y.S.3d 483, 483-84 (1st Dep't 2015)).
This rule is also subject to the exception that an employer is not required to provide accommodations that would subject it to undue hardship. Berger v. New York City Police Dep't, 304 F. Supp. 3d 360, 372 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (under the NYCHRL the definition of a reasonable accommodation means "'such accommodation that can be made that shall not cause undue hardship in the conduct of the [employer's] business.'" (alteration in original) (quoting N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-102(18)). Thus, once the plaintiff makes a prima facie case, "'the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that the employee's proposed accommodation would result in an undue hardship.'" Sivio, 436 F. Supp. 3d 778, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16729, 2020 WL 497513, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 31, 2020) (quoting Scalera v. Electrograph Sys., Inc., 848 F. Supp. 2d 352, 360 (E.D.N.Y. 2012)).
Here, Plaintiff has submitted evidence in the form of doctors' notes provided to the Human Resources Department at Lincoln Hospital indicating that he has anxiety and depression for which he receives therapy and takes medication. As such, he has demonstrated that he has a disability within the meaning of the NYCHRL. These notes also put the Hospital on notice of Plaintiff's disability. Plaintiff's claim falters, however, on [*103]  the third and fourth elements of his prima facie case. The focus of Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim is the Hospital's denial of his 2016 request for a transfer out of the Inpatient Psychiatric Service Unit, where he worked from March 2015 through July 2017. Plaintiff has made it clear that he did not enjoy working in the psychiatric unit. However, the Hospital has offered some evidence explaining that Plaintiff was reassigned to Inpatient Psychiatric Services Unit from PASA to address a staffing shortage in that Unit.
It is well established that an employer need only provide an accommodation that is "sufficient to meet the job-related needs of the individual being accommodated" and has no obligation to "to meet the personal preferences of disabled employees." Nieblas-Love, 165 F. Supp. 3d at 73 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In early 2016, Plaintiff's doctors cleared him to return to his job in the Psychiatric Unit without restriction. Although Plaintiff and his doctors asked that he be transferred "to another facility to support him and to avoid reoccurrence of anger issues," the request was not tied to performing any job function. (Doc. No. 180-53.) Plaintiff has provided no evidence whatsoever [*104]  to show that he could not perform the job of a Level II Social Worker unless he was transferred to another location/unit. In fact, all evidence is to the contrary. Plaintiff returned to work as a Level II Social Worker in the Psychiatric Unit and performed his job without accommodation for over a year. He also applied for, and contends he was qualified for, promotions during this time, all of which would have involved expanded job duties and for which Plaintiff required no accommodation. Thus, Plaintiff's request for a transfer was merely a preference and there is no reason for the jury to weigh in on whether Defendant HHC should have permitted Plaintiff to transfer as an accommodation. Cf. Jacobsen v. New York City Health & Hosps. Corp., 22 N.Y.3d 824, 839, 988 N.Y.S.2d 86, 11 N.E.3d 159, 170 (2014) (where plaintiff, a building inspector, was terminated after being diagnosed with breathing issues because he could no longer conduct inspections on construction sites, an issue of fact existed with respect to whether his request to transfer to another office that would require less construction site visits, where he had previously worked for decades, could serve as a reasonable accommodation).
The NYCHRL does not require an employer to accommodate the personal preferences of a disabled employee. [*105]  Kelly, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43485, 2017 WL 1133433, at *3; Nieblas-Love, 165 F. Supp. 3d at 73. Nor does an employer violate the NYCHRL by merely refusing to engage in an interactive dialogue about accommodating what was clearly a personal preference and not a reasonable accommodation necessary to permit the employee to perform the essential functions of his job. See Hayes v. Estee Lauder Companies, Inc., 34 A.D.3d 735, 737, 825 N.Y.S.2d 237, 239 (2006) ("[T]here is no controlling or persuasive authority holding that an employer may be held liable based solely on its failure to engage in an interactive process with an employee, absent a showing that the breakdown of the interactive process led to the employer's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation."). Because Plaintiff has failed to state a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the NYCHRL, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim.

CONCLUSION
In sum, the Court respectfully recommends that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgement be GRANTED except as to the following claims: (1) Plaintiff's claims of discriminatory failure to promote him to the MCU position under the NYCHRL and to the MICA position in 2015 under both Title VII and the NYCHRL; (2) Plaintiff's claims of retaliation with respect to denial of the promotions to the MCU and both MICA positions under Title VII and [*106]  the NYCHRL; and (3) Plaintiff's claims of retaliation with respect to verbal counseling, the removal of his supervisory duties in PASA, and his delay in promotion to Social Worker Level II under the NYCHRL; and (4) Plaintiff's claims of retaliation as to other various actions taken by Defendant HHC and/or Motal under Title VII and the NYCHRL.
