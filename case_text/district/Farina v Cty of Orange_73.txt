Opinion



DECISION & ORDER
PAUL E. DAVISON, U.S.M.J.:
Plaintiff Ronald G, Farina ("Plaintiff") commenced this action against Defendants County of Orange ("Defendant County" or "Defendant") and Sheriff Carl DuBois ("Defendant DuBois")1 to recover damages arising from purported violations of the American with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, § 504 ("RA") related to an on-the-job injury Plaintiff suffered while working as a Corrections Officer at the Orange County Correctional Facility ("OCCF"). Dkt. 1. This case is before me for all purposes on consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c). Dkt. 25. Presently before this Court is Defendant's motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: Dkts. 35 (Defendant's motion), 40 (Defendant's memorandum of law), 45 (Plaintiff's opposition), and 54 (Defendant's reply). [*2] 
For the reasons that follow, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.

I. BACKGROUND
The following facts — taken in the light most favorable to Plaintiff — are gathered from the parties' statements pursuant to Local Civil Rule 56.1 of the United States District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York from the pleadings, affidavits, affirmations and exhibits submitted by the parties in support of their contentions.

A. Plaintiff's Employment
On or about November 30, 2000, Plaintiff was hired as a Correction Officer in the Orange County Sheriff's Office. Plaintiff's Reply to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement and Counter-Statement, Dkt. 41 ("P. 56.1. Rep."), ¶ 1. In November of 2011, Plaintiff sustained an injury to his knee that required surgery. P. 56.1. Rep., ¶¶ 4-5. Plaintiff underwent another surgery in February of 2012 due to a cyst on his knee. P. 56,1. Rep., ¶ 4-5. Plaintiff suffered both of these injuries while off-duty. P. 56.1. Rep., ¶ 5. Following the surgery, Plaintiff applied for and was granted light duty,2 and returned to work on March 8, 2012. P. 56.1. Rep., ¶¶ 6, 7, 9.
On July 6, 2012, while on light duty, Plaintiff slipped and fell on a wet floor, reinjuring Ms knee and back. P. [*3]  56.1. Rep., ¶ 32; Declaration of Sharon Worthy-Spiegl, Dkt. 36 ("W-S Decl."); Ex. A, Complaint ("Cmp."), ¶ 28. Plaintiff applied for, but was denied, benefits under General Municipal Law § 207-c.3 P. 56.1. Rep., ¶ 33. The Hearing Officer determined that "The Orange County Sheriff's Department has the ability to assign an employee to light duty which would allow... Farina to sit and stand at his discretion, not to walk long distances, simply answer phones, look at a computer screen, and do administrative or ministerial light work." P. 56.1. Rep., ¶ 34; W-S Deck, Ex. G at 6 (at v). The Appellate Division affirmed the Hearing Officer's decision. P. 56.1. Rep., ¶ 35; Matter of Farina v. County of Orange, 133 A.D.3d. 747, 20 N.Y.S.3d 387 (2d Dept. 2015).
The events that follow are in dispute. Plaintiff contends that Defendant initially accommodated his medical restrictions in his work assignments, hut beginning in late March of 2012, Defendant assigned Plaintiff to posts that did not comply with his doctor-prescribed physical restrictions. Farina EBT at 93-119, 131-41, 151-57. The parties disagree as to which dates Plaintiff was assigned to which posts, but both parties agree that dining the relevant period, Plaintiff was assigned to: Key Room, Delta Control, Echo 1, Hallway and Visitation, Medical 1, Medical 2, and [*4]  Security Control posts. See Plaintiff's Reply to Defendant's 56.1 Statement and Counter-Statement, Dkt. 41 ("P. 56.1. Counter"), ¶¶ 21, 22, 24, 25, 54. Plaintiff maintains that all of these posts, except Med-2 and Security Control, violated his medical restrictions, and that although he made several requests for reassignments to superior officers, he was denied. P. 56.1. Counter, ¶ 11; Farina EBT at 93-119.
Defendant, on the other hand, contends that at all relevant times, Plaintiff was assigned to light duty posts that reasonably accommodated Plaintiff's medical restrictions because the posts did not require him to climb stairs, allowed him to sit, stand and ambulate as desired, and, in some cases, required no inmate contact. W-S Deck, Ex. D ("Jones EBT") at 17-18, 431; Farina EBT at 141, 83-84, 95-96, 292, 291-92, 388. Although Plaintiff admits that Defendant provided him with a chair for sitting at all these posts, Plaintiff asserted that many of these posts still violated his medical restrictions because he had to walk far more than the 50 yard limitation recommended by his physician. P. 56.1. Rep., ¶¶ 45, 57, 62.
Defendant asserts that it is the shift commander's discretion to choose a post that is consistent with the stated physical limitations [*5]  and that there were only a few posts available to correction officers who cannot fully perform their duties, including Delta Control, Key Room, Security Control, and certain posts in Visitation where there is a desk. P. 56.1. Rep., ¶ 26; Jones BBT at 17-18. Plaintiff contends these posts were all contrary to his medical restrictions, P. 56.1. Rep. ¶ 27; Declaration of Christopher Watkins, Dkt. 48 ("Watkins Deck"), Exs. 2-32; Farina EBT at 92-103, 131-141, 144-47, 310-12, 450-52, 478-79, and that at all relevant times, Plaintiff could have been assigned to Security Control, P, 56.1. Counter, ¶ 26; Farina EBT at 244-245, 583, or Med-2, P. 56.1 Counter, ¶ 27; P. 56,1. Rep., ¶ 105, each of which would have better accommodated his medical restrictions. Plaintiff also claims that Defendant regularly assigned officers who had no medical restrictions to Security Control and Med-2. P, 56.1. Counter, ¶¶ 28, 29.
Plaintiff notified his superior officers that he was medically restricted from working overtime, yet was obligated to work overtime on at least two separate occasions. P, 56.1. Counter, ¶¶ 13-14; Farina EBT at 98400, 114-15; Watkins Deck, Ex. 32 at PP0001; Id., Ex. 35 at 001409.
On June 6 and 13, 2012, Plaintiff submitted new medical restriction notes from his surgeon that indicated his condition had worsened and reduced [*6]  his maximum walking distance from 50 yards to 20 yards. P. 56.1. Counter, ¶¶ 15, 16, 17; Watkins Deck, Exs. 8, 9. According to Plaintiff's physician, Plaintiff's back and knee conditions were deteriorating because his work assignments contradicted his medical restrictions. P. 56.1. Counter, ¶ 58; Farina EBT at 462, 477-78.

B. Plaintiff's Termination
In March of 2014, Plaintiff underwent surgery for his worsened back condition. P. 56.1. Rep., ¶ 98; Farina EBT at 573. In or about October 30, 2014, Plaintiff underwent a second surgery for his knee. P. 56.1, Rep., ¶ 99; Cmp. ¶ 193; W-S Deck, Ex. A; Farina EBT at 574. Farina did not return to work at any time between the two surgeries. P. 56.1. Rep., ¶ 100; Farina EBT at 574. On or about April 3, 2015, Farina's employment was terminated under New York State Civil Service Law § 73, because he had been absent for more than one year, P. 56.1. Rep., ¶ 101; Cmp. ¶ 194; Farina EBT at 581-82.

II. LEGAL STANDARD

A. Summary Judgment
Summary judgment is appropriate "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A fact is material under Rule 56 if it "might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute about a material fact is [*7]  "genuine" when "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party" Id. at 248. In determining whether the moving party has met its burden of proving that there are no genuine disputes of material fact, the court must resolve all ambiguities and draw all factual inferences in favor of the party opposing the motion. See Vivenzio v. City of Syracuse, 611 F.3d 98, 106 (2d Cir. 2010), "Assessments of credibility and choices between conflicting versions of the events are matters for the jury, not for the court on summary judgment" Jeffreys v. City of New York, 426 F.3d 549, 553 (2d Cir. 2005) (citations omitted).
The moving party must initially point to evidence in the record, "including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations ... or other materials," Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A), which "demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The moving party may also support an assertion that there is no genuine dispute by "showing . . . that [the] adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(B). If the moving party fulfills its preliminary burden, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to raise the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 41 (2d Cir. 2000). "Statements that are devoid of any specifics, but replete with conclusions, [*8]  are insufficient to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment." Bickerstaff v. Vassar Coll., 196 F.3d 435, 452 (2d Cir. 1999); see also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts"). "While circumstantial evidence is considered on a motion for summary judgment, mere speculation and conjecture are insufficient to defeat the motion." MBB Realty Ltd. P'ship v. A&P, 509 B.R. 430, 442 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (citations omitted). "If the evidence presented by the non-moving party is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted," Scotto v. Almenas, 143 F.3d 105, 114 (2d Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted).
Where "the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof at trial, summary judgment is warranted if the nonmovant fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [its] case." Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U.S. 584, 590, 113 S. Ct. 1689, 123 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1993) (alteration in original) (quotation and citation omitted). Thus, "[a] defendant moving for summary judgment must prevail if the plaintiff fails to come forward with enough evidence to create a genuine factual issue to be tried with respect to an element essential to its case." Allen v. Cuomo, 100 F.3d 253, 258 (2d Cir. 1996). On the other hand, summary judgment must be denied if the court finds "there are any genuine factual issues that properly can [*9]  be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party." See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250.

B. ADA and RA Claims
Congress enacted the ADA "to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1). To that end, Title II of the ADA provides that "no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity" Id. § 12132. A qualified individual with a disability is defined as "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices . . . meets the essential eligibility requirements for . . . participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity." Id. § 12131(2). A public entity includes a state or local government body or any instrumentality thereof. Id. § 12131(1).
Section 504 of the RA provides, in pertinent part, that "[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied [*10]  the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity." 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). By its terms, the RA, which was enacted prior to the ADA, applies only to programs receiving federal financial support. Id.; see Powell v. Nat'l Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 364 F.3d 79, 85 (2d Cir.), opinion corrected, 511 F.3d 238 (2d Cir. 2004).
Both acts "prohibit discrimination against qualified disabled individuals by requiring that they receive 'reasonable accommodations' that permit them to have access to and take a meaningful part in . . . public accommodations." Id. The ADA defines "discriminate" as, inter alia, "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . unless [the provider of the service] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on" its operations. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). Under the RA "an otherwise qualified handicapped individual must be provided with meaningful access to the benefit that the grantee offers . . . . [T]o assure meaningful access, reasonable accommodations in the grantee's program or benefit may have to be made." Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301, 105 S. Ct. 712, 83 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1985); Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 273 (2d Cir. 2003).

III. DISCUSSION
Defendant moves for summary judgment for several reasons: (i) Plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination because [*11]  Defendant provided a reasonable accommodation for Plaintiff even though Plaintiff was unqualified to perform the essential functions of his job; (ii) Plaintiff failed to establish an intentional violation of the ADA; (iii) Plaintiff failed to establish that Defendant's alleged failure to provide a reasonable accommodation exacerbated his injuries; (iv) Plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation; (v) Plaintiff's claims are time-barred under the ADA; and (vi) Plaintiff is collaterally estopped from claiming he was unfit to perform light duty following his injury. Dkts. 40, 54. In his response, Plaintiff withdraws his retaliation claims, and asserts that (i) he established a prima facie case of discrimination because Defendant failed to provide a reasonable accommodation through which he could have performed the essential functions of his job; (ii) Plaintiff's exacerbation of injury claim is a damages issue best reserved for trial; (iii) Plaintiff's claims are not time-barred because the RA's three year statute of limitation applies; and (iv) Defendant's collateral estoppel argument fails because the Second Department found facts in favor of Plaintiff's position. [*12]  Dkt. 45.

A. Plaintiff's Prima Facie Case of Discrimination
Because the standards for actions under the ADA and RA are nearly equivalent, courts generally analyze them in the same manner, Dean v. Univ. at Buffalo Sch. of Med. & Biomedical Sets., 804 F.3d 178, 187 (2d Cir. 2015) (citing Harris v. Mills, 572 F.3d 66, 73-74 (2d Cir. 2009)). Thus, in accordance with this practice, to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under either act, Plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) his employer is subject to the regulations; (2) he was disabled within the meaning of the regulations; (3) he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without a reasonable accommodation; and (4) he suffered an adverse employment action as a result of his disability. Dean v. Univ. at Buffalo Sch. of Med. & Biomedical Scis., 804 F.3d 178, 187 (2d Cir. 2015).
Here, Plaintiff establishes the first element because the Orange County Sheriff's Department is a "covered entity" subject to the regulations of the ADA and RA because it is "engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(e). Plaintiff also establishes the second element — that he was disabled within the meaning of these regulations — because he has a recorded knee and back injury that, as required by the statute, gave him "a physical impairment... [*13]  that substantially limits one or more life activities," and his employer regarded him as having such impairment. Id. § 1630.2(g). The fourth element is established because Plaintiff was terminated and thus suffered an adverse employment action as a result of his disability. The third element — whether Plaintiff was qualified to perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation — remains in dispute and is discussed further below.

1. Third Element: Reasonable Accommodation and Essential Functions
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie ease of discrimination because it provided Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation by assigning him to light duty posts that allowed him to sit, stand and ambulate as desired, and in some cases did not require inmate contact or climbing stairs. D. Mem. at 6, 13, 14 (citing Jones EBT at 17-18, 431; Farina EBT at 141, 83-84, 95-96, 291-92, 388). Plaintiff contends that Defendant failed to provide a reasonable accommodation because he was assigned to posts that violated his medical restrictions. P. Mem. at 13, 15.

a. Reasonable Accommodation
An employer violates the ADA and the RA when it fails to "make reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an other-wise qualified [*14]  individual with a disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); see also 29 U.S.C § 794(d) (stating that ADA's standards govern determinations whether employers have violated the employment provisions of the RA). The ADA explains that the term "reasonable accommodation" includes "[m]odifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions of that position." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii). Examples of such reasonable accommodations include job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, and reassignment to a vacant position. 42 U.S.C.S. § 12111(9)(B). As to the requirement that an accommodation be reasonable, "plaintiff bears only a burden of production." Borkowski v. Valley Cent. Sch Dist., 63 F.3d 131, 138 (2d Cir. 1995). This burden is not a heavy one. Borkowski, at 138. "It is enough for the plaintiff to suggest the existence of a plausible accommodation, the costs of which, facially, do not clearly exceed its benefits." Id. If the plaintiff is able to show that a reasonable accommodation existed, "the burden of persuasion then shifts to the defendant to 'rebut the reasonableness of the proposed accommodation,' that the proposed accommodation would cause [the defendant] [*15]  to suffer an undue hardship." Wright v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 831 F.3d 64, 76 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Borkowski, 63 F.3d at 138).
Undue hardship is defined as "an action requiring significant difficulty or expense..." 42 U.S.C. at §12111(10)(A), The regulations provide that "[i]n determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on a covered entity, factors to be considered include:
(i) the nature and cost of the accommodation needed under this Act;
(ii) the overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved in the provision of the reasonable accommodation; the number of persons employed at such facility; the effect on expenses and resources, or the impact otherwise of such accommodation upon the operation of the facility;
(iii) the overall financial resources of the covered entity; the overall size of the business of a covered entity with respect to the number of its employees; the number, type, and location of its facilities; and
(iv) the type of operation or operations of the covered entity, including the composition, structure, and functions of the workforce of such entity; the geographic separateness, administrative, or fiscal relationship of the facility or facilities in question to the covered entity.
42 U.S.C.S. § 12111.; 34 C.F.R. § 104.12(b).

i. Application
Plaintiff has identified two [*16]  posts — Security Control and Med-2 — which he contends were vacant positions in which he could perform the essential functions of his employment.4 Therefore, the burden shifts to Defendant to rebut the reasonableness of the proposed accommodation by showing that it would cause Defendant to suffer an undue hardship. Wright v. N.Y. State Dep't of Con. & Cmty. Supervision, 831 F.3d 64, 76 (2d Cir. 2016).

1. Security Control
Plaintiff's asserts that Security Control was available from January 2012 through March 2013 because Plaintiff was assigned to it for three weeks after his February 2012 surgery until Defendant assigned other officers who, according to Plaintiff, had no medical restrictions. In response, Defendant has shown that there were between ten and twenty other correction officers on light duty that also needed to be assigned to Security Control to accommodate their respective medical restrictions. Jones Aff., ¶¶ 19-25; Mele Aff., ¶ 16.
Defendant also proffered evidence that the Security Control post could not be made available to any and all officers because it requires at least one of the two necessary officers to have full knowledge of the security system and experience controlling the doors as errors in its management could result in physical harm to individuals [*17]  and, at worst, lead to an escape from the facility. D. Reply at 7 (citing Mele Reply Affidavit, Dkt. 53 ("Mele Aff."), ¶¶ 10-12). By Plaintiff's own admission, he was not always mentally alert because of the effects of his medication. Mele Aff., ¶ 13; Farina EBT at 219-20. Since mental alertness in Security Control is critical, he would not have been able to fully perform the essential functions of this position, and could have undermined the safety of the entire facility.
Even though there were several other officers on light duty, only a single position available in the Security Control post, and important safety considerations for Defendant to consider, Defendant still occasionally assigned Plaintiff to Security Control. To require Defendant to assign Plaintiff to Security Control full time would be "an action requiring significant difficulty or expense," 42 U.S.C. at § 12111(10)(A), and would have caused Defendant undue hardship. Accordingly, Defendant was not obligated to assign Plaintiff to Security Control on a permanent basis in order to accommodate his disability.

2. Med-2
With respect to Plaintiff's demand to be placed in Med-2 if Security Control was not available, Defendant proffered evidence that a Med-2 [*18]  posting was only available on a very limited basis. D. Reply at 7, Med-2 is a specialized five cell unit used only as necessary for particular purposes, such as isolating an inmate, housing a pregnant inmate, or observing an inmate. Defendant assigned correction officers to Med-2 based on whether the inmate was violent, old, sick, male, female, or on a "no contact" list, among other factors. When one-on-one supervision of a female inmate was necessary, only female officers could be assigned to the unit. Mele Aff., ¶¶ 18-21. It would have been impossible to assign Plaintiff to Med-2 with any regularity because it was not always open, sometimes only housed women, and at other times, Defendant accommodated the other officers on light duty. For example, in 2013, Med-2 was closed approximately 26% of the year, occupied by females 11% of the year, and housed male inmates approximately 63% of the year. W-S Decl., Ex. K, Mele Aff., ¶ 24; Id., Ex. B, As a result, Defendant could not have assigned Plaintiff to that post more than 63% of the year, and likely even less since Defendant also had to accommodate the restrictions of all the other officers on light duty. Requiring that Defendant assign [*19]  Plaintiff to Med-2 if Security Control was not available would be an "action requiring significant difficulty," 42 U.S.C. § 12111(10)(A), and would have imposed an undue hardship on Defendant.
Given that Defendant occasionally assigned Plaintiff to the Med-2 unit despite the limited availability of that post and the ten to twenty other officers also on light duty during this period, no reasonable juror could find that Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff by declining to assign him to Med-2 whenever Security Control was unavailable.

3. Permanent Light Duty
To the extent Plaintiff's request to be assigned exclusively to Security Control or Med-2 was a request to be permanently assigned to light duty, as a rule, Defendant did not provide such permanent positions to corrections officers. D. Reply at 6 (Affidavit of Kenneth T. Jones ("Jones Aff."), Dkt. 37, ¶ 12; Mele Reply Aff., ¶ 17). The Orange County Sheriff's Office On-Duty and Off-Duty Injury Temporary Light Duty Reporting Documenting and Procedures Memorandum provides that its light duty policy is intended to accommodate its officers on a temporary basis and permit them to recover until they can resume full duty. Jones Aff., ¶ 12, Ex. B (Defendant's [*20]  light duty policy). In particular, Defendant's light duty policy provides:
The Sheriff's Office makes available on a case by case basis, subject to the needs of the Sheriff's Office, temporary light duty assignments for officers that are injured or suffer an illness while off-duty (not subject to 207-c)... No permanent light duty is available. The Sheriff's Office has no contractual/legal obligation to make a temporary light duty assignment available and therefore such assignments are at the discretion of the Sheriff or designee.
Jones Aff., Ex. B at 5 (emphasis added).
Anthony Mele, Acting Administrator of the Orange County Correctional Facility since January 12, 2018, confirmed that "[n]o individual is ever assigned to Security Control or any other post on a permanent basis to accommodate an officer's injury, physical limitation and/or medical condition." Mele Reply Affidavit, Dkt. 53, ¶ 17.
Requiring Defendant to institute a permanent light duty policy for Plaintiff despite its clear policy against it would have required significant difficulty and expense, and would have caused Defendant undue hardship. No reasonable juror could find that Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff [*21]  by declining to assign him to light duty permanently.

ii. Conclusion as to Reasonable Accommodation
While Defendant did not provide the accommodation Plaintiff sought, it is undisputed that it afforded him an alternative one: Defendant reassigned Plaintiff to vacant light duty posts. P. 56.1 Rep., ¶¶ 45, 57, 62.
Defendant was not obligated to assign Plaintiff permanently to either Security Control or Med-2, or required to remove other officers from these posts in order to comply with the law. Fink v. New York City Dep't of Personnel, 855 F. Supp. 68, 72 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), aff'd, 53 F.3d 565, 567 (2d Cir. 1995) (An employer need only offer a "reasonable accommodation"; it need not provide the employee with the accommodation of her choice.) (citations omitted); Noll v. International Business Machines Corp., 787 F.3d 89, 95 (2d Cir. 2015) (An employer is "not required to provide a perfect accommodation or the very accommodation most strongly preferred by the employee."). Indeed, "[r]eassignment of a disabled employee to a vacant light-duty position is well established as a reasonable accommodation under the ADA." King v. Town of Wallkill, 302 F. Supp. 2d 279, 291 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (citations omitted). By reassigning Plaintiff to "light duty" assignments, Defendant satisfied its obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation under the Acts, Accordingly, Defendant has carried its burden of demonstrating the absence of genuine material factual [*22]  issues for trial.

b. Qualified to Perform the Essential Functions
In the alternative, Defendant argues that even if the Court found Defendant had failed to provide a reasonable accommodation, Plaintiff was not otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of a correction officer.
Plaintiff contends that he could have performed the essential functions of his job if assigned to Security Control. P. Mem. at 13. Defendant asserts that monitoring inmates via a security surveillance system in the Security Control post does not fully encompass the essential functions of a corrections officer. D. Reply at 3 ("[w]hile this one activity may be the essential function of one post, it certainly does not encompass the essential functions of the job that are necessary for the care, custody and control of inmates."). The Court agrees.
Essential functions are defined under Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") regulations to include the "fundamental" duties to be performed in the position in question, but not functions that are merely "marginal." Stone v. City of Mount Vernon, 118 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 1997) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1)(1996)), To determine "whether a plaintiff can perform the essential functions of his position, [the] court must give considerable [*23]  deference to an employer's judgment regarding what functions are essential for service in a particular position," D'Amico v. City of New York, 132 F.3d 145, 151 (2d Cir. 1998); Sevens v. Rite Aid Corporation, 851 F.3d 224, 229 (2d Cir. 2017); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).
Here, the Orange County Class Specification for the position of Corrections Officer includes "the care, custody, and control" of the Defendant's inmates as essential functions.5 Jones Aff., Ex. E; Id., Ex. A. The Job Description also lists "typical work activities," including "[m]aintain[ing] security at assigned posts throughout the Correctional Facility," such as "mak[ing] timely rounds of assigned housing units," Id. "Correction officers must also supervise inmates and conduct checks of inmates and inmate areas for contraband or unauthorized items," Jones Aff., Ex. A. "All correction officers are to be in 'physical condition commensurate with the demands of the position" because this "[w]ork ... may, at times require strenuous physical exertion in dealing with uncooperative inmates." Jones Aff., Ex. A.
The record indicates that Plaintiff was unable to perform the essential functions of his job, Plaintiff's physician, Daniel Tomlinson, M.D., wrote that although Plaintiff may return to work, he "may only do primarily sedentary work and minimal standing or walking [*24]  ..." Watkins Decl., Ex. 2. Plaintiff himself also admits he was unable to make rounds to supervise inmates, pat search inmates — irrefutably essential functions of a corrections officer. In fact, Plaintiff himself asserted that many of the light duty posts violated his medical restrictions because lie had to walk far more than the 50 yards recommended by his physician. P. 56.1. Rep., ¶¶ 45, 57, 62. Plaintiff's physicians' treatment notes also indicate that Plaintiff's condition would not improve. Watkins Decl., Ex. 9 ("[e]ven with proper treatment employee will not recover physical abilities"), Exs. 12, 20, 25 ("[w]ith proper treatment employee has only a limited change [sic] of recovering physical abilities"). Indeed, on June 6 and 13, 2012, Plaintiff submitted new medical restriction notes from his surgeon indicating that his condition had worsened and reducing his maximum walking distance from 50 yards to 20 yards, P. 56.1, Counter, ¶¶ 15, 16, 17; Watkins Decl., Exs. 8, 9.
The Second Circuit holding in Davis v. NYC Health and Hospitals Corp., 508 Fed. Appx. 26, 29 (2d Cir. 2013) (summary order) on this subject is persuasive. There, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court's deference to the employer's judgment that Plaintiff could not perform the essential [*25]  functions of her job as head nurse because her physical limitations precluded her ability to respond to medical emergencies, among other functions determined to be necessary functions of a nurse. Id. In the correction officer context, a court in this district has found that a corrections captain suffering from anxiety and depression was not qualified to perform the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodation where her symptoms compromised her ability to be focused and alert. Shepheard v. City of New York, 577 F. Supp. 2d 669 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) aff'd by 360 Fed. App'x 249 (2d Cir. 2009). Similarly, in Flieger v. E, Suffolk BOCES, plaintiff failed to meet her burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow her to continue to perform ail of the essential functions of her Teaching Assistant job where plaintiff was unable to physically hold or escort a student in danger of causing injury to him or herself or others, or perform or administer crisis intervention or prevention techniques. No. 13 Civ. 6282, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81987, at *36-47 (E.D.N.Y. June 23, 2016) aff'd by 693 Fed. App'x, 14, 20 (2d Cir. 2017). Like the plaintiffs in the cases mentioned above, Plaintiff here also had limitations incompatible with the essential functions of his job, namely, the care, custody and control of inmates. Jones Aff., Ex. A.
This record makes clear that even with a reasonable [*26]  accommodation, Plaintiff was unable to perform the essential functions of a corrections officer, Accordingly, Defendant has carried its burden of demonstrating the absence of genuine material factual issues for trial. Summary judgment is appropriate.6

IV. CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment in its entirety. The Cleric shall terminate the motion (Dkt. 35) and close this case.
