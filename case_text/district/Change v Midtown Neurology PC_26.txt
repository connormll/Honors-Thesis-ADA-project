Opinion



UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This matter is presently before the Court on Defendant Midtown Neurology, P.C.'s Motion for Summary Judgment. [Doc. 45]. For the reasons set forth below, the Court RECOMMENDS that the District Judge GRANT the motion.

I. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment is proper when no genuine issue as to any material fact is present, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party carries the initial burden of "informing the court of the basis for its motion and of identifying those materials that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Rice-Lamar v. City of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., 232 F.3d 836, 840 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). A fact is "material" if it "might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The moving party may also meet its burden by pointing out that [*2]  there is an absence of evidence to support an element of the case on which the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. "Only when that burden has been met does the burden shift to the non-moving party to demonstrate that there is indeed a material issue of fact that precludes summary judgment." Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991).
The nonmoving party is then required "to go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence in the form of affidavits, depositions, admissions, and the like, designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. The Court must view the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See United States v. Four Parcels of Real Prop., 941 F.2d 1428, 1437 (11th Cir. 1991) (en banc). And, to the extent that material facts are genuinely in dispute, the Court must resolve the disputes in the nonmovant's favor. See Vaughan v. Cox, 343 F.3d 1323, 1326 n.1 (11th Cir. 2003).
However, "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" supporting the nonmovant's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. Additionally, "facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only if there is a 'genuine' dispute as to those facts." Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007). "When opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, [*3]  so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Id. If the record does not blatantly contradict the nonmovant's version of events, the court must determine "whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; accord EPL, Inc. v. USA Fed. Credit Union, 173 F.3d 1356, 1362 (11th Cir. 1999). "If the record presents disputed issues of fact, the court may not decide them; rather, it must deny the motion and proceed to trial." FindWhat Inv. Grp. v. FindWhat.com, 658 F.3d 1282, 1307 (11th Cir. 2011) (citing Tullius v. Albright, 240 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir. 2001)).

II. BACKGROUND

A. Facts 1
In July 2018, Defendant Midtown Neurology, P.C., hired Plaintiff Aisha Change to fill an opening as a Botox Coordinator, and her first date of employment was July 30, 2018. [D ¶ 1].2 On that date, Plaintiff completed an insurance application for Humana Insurance to join Defendant's health plan and on that form reported that she was not disabled. [D ¶ 6; see also Doc. 45-3 at 272 (Change Depo. Ex. 5)].3
Plaintiff interviewed for the position with Juanita Williams, Billing Manager, and Nakesha Jackson-Moultrie, who was the Botox Coordinator for the last year but was transitioning out of the role. [D ¶ 7]. Plaintiff subsequently trained with Jackson-Moultrie [*4]  in the Botox Coordinator position. [D ¶ 9]. Plaintiff reported to Williams, who in turn reported to Deirdre Plato, Defendant's Practice Manager. [D ¶ 10]. For her first 90 days of employment, Plaintiff was considered to be on probation; as a probationary employee, she was not eligible for paid vacation, sick, or personal leave. [D ¶ 36].4
The essential duties of the Botox Coordinator position included obtaining precertification for Botox patients, verifying patient insurance, coordinating authorizations with physicians, informing patients of their out-of-pocket expenses for Botox treatment, collecting funds for Botox treatment from patients, keeping inventory of Botox stock, ensuring the practice has enough Botox in stock for cosmetic as well as medically necessary uses, and monitoring accounts receivable related to Botox treatments. [D ¶ 16]. Defendant received shipments of Botox multiple times a week and sometimes multiple times a day. [D ¶ 18]. Those shipments needed to be unpacked and put in a refrigerator, which tasks took two to three minutes. [D ¶ 18; DRP ¶ 18].5 Taking an inventory of the Botox supply took an additional 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the day. [P ¶ 38; [*5]  DRP ¶ 38].6 Plaintiff never performed some of the essential duties during her employment. [P ¶ 36].7
Plaintiff asserts that, at the time she was hired, she discussed working remotely with Jackson-Moultrie and was told she could "do remote." [D ¶ 20]. Plaintiff was encouraged to bring her personal laptop in so that the IT department could install a VPN on it but Plaintiff never got the remote software working on her computer and never logged in remotely. [D ¶¶ 22-23]. Whenever Plaintiff needed to be away from work for medical reasons she offered to perform work remotely, including beginning August 27, 2018, following a surgery. [P ¶ 22]. Plaintiff tried to work remotely but was told that someone else would cover her work instead. [P ¶ 41; DRP ¶ 41].8 Plaintiff never worked remotely and when she was out her duties were covered by other employees. [D ¶ 24]. However, Jackson-Moultrie testified that the Botox Coordinator position could not be performed remotely and that she did not work remotely instead of coming into the office, stating "You can't work Botox remotely." [D ¶ 32].9
Plaintiff was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri ("PTC") in May 2018, [*6]  roughly two months prior to her beginning employment with Defendant. [D ¶ 11]. Between early 2018 and September 2019, Plaintiff's PTC caused her to experience ringing in her ears, foggy vision, headaches, forgetfulness, and dizziness. [D ¶ 13; PRD ¶ 13].10 If left untreated, PTC may lead to permanent double vision or blindness. [P ¶ 8].
Plaintiff learned to adjust to her PTC and there was nothing she could not do with it that she was otherwise able to do. [D ¶ 14].11 For example, Plaintiff still could drive, pick up her mother, cook for five, and do her daily functions. [Id.]. Plaintiff could do everything that she would normally do. [Id.].
Plaintiff underwent nine surgeries between June 2018 and September 2019. [D ¶ 15]. Plaintiff had inserted spinal fluid shunts and multiple spinal taps, both meant to drain cerebrospinal fluid away from the cranial area. [P ¶ 10]. Each time Plaintiff had a spinal tap, Plaintiff had to lay down for approximately two days to recover and, after spinal shunt surgery, she usually had to lay down about a week to recover. [P ¶ 11].12 Plaintiff was symptom free as of October 2019. [D ¶ 15].
These treatments prevented her from going into [*7]  the office "for a period of time in order to recover." [P ¶ 12]. Plaintiff was not at work for 28 of the 59 business days that she was employed by Defendant. [D ¶ 56; PRD ¶ 56].13 Plaintiff's absences caused great strain on Defendant's business. [D ¶ 50; PRD ¶ 50].14 Plaintiff began her employment with Defendant on July 30, 2018 and missed four days in her first two weeks. [D ¶¶ 38, 40]. The absences the second week were for a lumbar puncture. [D ¶ 39]. Plaintiff clocked in each day of her third week, but on August 17, 2018 she informed Williams that she would need to be out for surgery from August 21, 2018 until September 17, 2018, tentatively. [D ¶¶ 41-42]. Plaintiff indicated that as of August 27, she would "work remotely on all aspects with the exception of physically handling the medication while in office." [D ¶ 42]. Defendant allowed Plaintiff to take off as much time as needed relative to her surgery on August 21, 2018. [D ¶ 45].
Plaintiff returned to work on September 4, 2018. [D ¶ 46]. On September 5, 2018, Plaintiff submitted a doctor's note requesting that she be excused until September 22, 2018 and asking that she be permitted to perform light duty from [*8]  home. [D ¶ 48]. After returning to work on September 24, 2019, Plaintiff worked every day that week except Thursday, which she took off for bereavement leave. [D ¶ 52]. Over the next two weeks, she worked full days except for the first Friday, when she worked a half-day, and the second Friday, October 12, 2020, which she took off for a CT scan. [D ¶ 53]. Plaintiff worked on Monday, October 15 and Tuesday, October 16, but fell of her chair on that day and was told to remain home on October 17 and 18. [D ¶ 54].
On October 15, 2018, Plaintiff informed Williams that she would need another surgery, likely in late October. [P ¶ 42]. Plaintiff informed Williams that she would likely need about a week out of the office afterwards. [P ¶ 43; DRP ¶ 43].15 On Friday, October 19, 2018, Williams met with Plaintiff and asked her to resign and, when she refused, Williams terminated her. [P ¶ 47].16 Friday, October 19, 2018 was Plaintiff's final day of her employment. [D ¶ 55]. Prior to her termination, Plaintiff was allowed to take time off for medical reasons as needed and was not told there was a problem or that her job was in jeopardy. [P ¶ 26].

B. Procedural History
Plaintiff filed her [*9]  initial complaint on February 22, 2019. [Doc. 1]. On March 21, 2019, Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss, [Doc. 6], and on April 4, 2019, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint, [Doc. 9]. On April 18, 2019, Defendant filed an answer to Plaintiff's amended complaint and the Court subsequently denied the Motion to Dismiss as moot. [Docs. 12, 36, 38].
In her amended complaint, Plaintiff alleges discrimination and retaliation in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq. ("ADA"). [Doc. 9 at 7-10].
Defendant filed its motion for summary judgment on March 23, 2020, [Doc. 45], Plaintiff filed her response on May 18, 2020, after seeking permission to include excess pages, [see Docs. 52-54], and Defendant filed a reply brief on June 28, 2020, [Doc. 60]. The Court subsequently ordered the parties to file amended response and reply briefs to comply with the Local Rules and the Court's scheduling order. [See Docs. 67-69]. The Court cites to the amended materials here. Revised briefing was completed on December 23, 2020. (See Dkt.).

III. ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES
Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because, even considered in the light most favorable to her, Plaintiff cannot establish the elements of [*10]  her ADA claims. [Doc. 45-1 at 5]. First, Defendant contends that Plaintiff cannot show that she was disabled under the ADA. [Id. at 6]. It claims that Plaintiff admitted that she was not actually disabled because in her deposition she stated that her condition did not substantially limit any major life activities, and that this admission negates any possibility that she was actually disabled under the ADA. [Id. at 7]. Defendant then argues that Plaintiff's PTC caused ringing in her ears, visual changes, and headaches, but did not interfere with her ability to perform daily functions. [Id.]. Defendant contends that no reasonable jury could find her disabled on this evidence. [Id. at 8].
Defendant also submits that no reasonable jury could find that it regarded Plaintiff as disabled, because she did not articulate in any evidence how or why she believed this to be the case. [Id.]. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's conclusory assertion that it "regarded" her as disabled is insufficient. [Id. at 8-9]. Defendant contends that, even if it suggested that Plaintiff resign because she needed additional time off for another surgery, which it denies, having done so would not indicate that it regarded [*11]  her as disabled but would be a recognition of Plaintiff's limitations. [Id. at 9-10].
Next, Defendant argues that even if Plaintiff was disabled, she was not qualified to work as the Botox Coordinator because she reported to work only about half the time. [Id. at 10]. Defendant asserts that one of the essential duties of the Botox Coordinator includes doing inventory duty, which must be done daily. [Id. at 11]. It further points out that Jackson-Moultrie, who previously worked as the Botox Coordinator, testified that the position required being physically present in the office. [Id. at 11-12]. Defendant argues it is undisputed that Plaintiff was absent at least 29 of the 59 days she was employed and also was going to be out for an additional surgery; therefore, she could not perform the essential functions of the Botox Coordinator position. [Id. at 12].
Defendant also claims that Plaintiff did not request any reasonable accommodation for her disability. [Id. at 13]. Defendant contends that the August 17 email that Plaintiff identifies is insufficient because in it she unilaterally asserted that she would work remotely starting on August 27 without follow-up or any effort to actually [*12]  do so. [Id. at 14-15]. Defendant argues that this is insufficient because it is an assertion and not a request, and Defendant could not have agreed to it in any event because the position required in-office presence. [Id. at 14]. Defendant further contends that the September 5 doctor's note Plaintiff identifies is not a legally sufficient request for accommodation because the note itself is equivocal and Plaintiff never contacted it to follow-up about the note. [Id. at 14-15]. Finally, Defendant argues that when Plaintiff informed Williams in mid-October that she was having surgery and would need indefinite time off, she did not request a leave of absence or any other accommodation. [Id. at 15].
Defendant next contends that working remotely is not a reasonable accommodation because it would not have enabled Plaintiff to perform the essential functions of the Botox Coordinator position. [Id.]. Defendant argues that, for Plaintiff to work from home, it would have had to eliminate many of the essential functions of the Botox Coordinator position. [Id. at 16]. Defendant also notes that Jackson-Moultrie testified that the position could not be done remotely and that Williams confirmed that [*13]  none of the back-office employees could perform all of their work from home. [Id. at 16-17]. Defendant contends that, even without regard to the job-specific duties of the Botox Coordinator, attendance at work is an essential function of any position it offered. [Id. at 17]. Defendant submits that other employees had to cover Plaintiff's responsibilities while she is gone, placing a strain on its business operations. [Id. at 17-18 (citing [D ¶ 50]]. It argues that settled law holds that employees who cannot be present at work on a regular basis are not qualified individuals for purposes of the ADA. [Id. at 18-19].
Defendant contends that, even if Plaintiff requested an additional leave of absence, such would not have been a reasonable accommodation because any request was indefinite. [Id. at 19]. It argues that Plaintiff testified unequivocally that she did not request a leave of absence and admitted that each of the times she informed Williams she would be out of the office she was unable to say when she would return. [Id. at 19-20].
Defendant further contends that Plaintiff cannot show that it discriminated against her because of any disability. [Id. at 20-21]. It argues, first, that [*14]  Plaintiff did not suffer an adverse employment action because she resigned and her assertion that she was told to resign or would be terminated is only supported by her own self-serving testimony. [Id. at 21]. Defendant further argues that Plaintiff did not allege a failure to accommodate claim but, if she had, summary judgment is appropriate as to such a claim because any accommodation sought was unreasonable and created an undue hardship on it. [Id. at 21 n.6]. Second, Defendant contends that even if Plaintiff was terminated she cannot show it was because of her disability because she cannot identify any similarly-situated employee outside of her protected class who was treated more favorably. [Id. at 22-23]. In fact, Defendant argues, by allowing Plaintiff to take so much time off, it was treating her more favorably than other employees. [Id. at 23].
Defendant also contends that Plaintiff cannot establish ADA retaliation because she did not engage in any protected activity. [Id.]. Defendant argues that Plaintiff never sought a reasonable accommodation and, even if she had, she cannot prove that she had an objective good faith belief that such activity was protected. [Id. at 23-24]. [*15]  It claims that Plaintiff's testimony that her condition did not affect her major life activities prevents a finding that she was either objectively disabled or a good faith belief that she was disabled. [Id. at 24-25]. Defendant further argues that Plaintiff cannot establish the requisite good-faith objectively-reasonable belief as to her demands for time away or working remotely. [Id. at 25].
Defendant then argues that, even if Plaintiff engaged in protected activity, her retaliation claim still fails because she resigned and thus she did not suffer any adverse employment action. [Id.]. Defendant contends that the only contrary evidence is Plaintiff's own self-serving testimony, but that is insufficient alone to create an issue of material fact. [Id. at 26]. Defendant claims that all the other evidence indicates that she resigned. [Id.]. In addition, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish but-for causation required for an ADA retaliation claim because, if she had been fired, it would have been for her excessive absenteeism and not because of any protected activity. [Id. at 27-28].
Finally, Defendant argues that even if Plaintiff was separated involuntarily, she cannot establish [*16]  that the decision to fire her was pretext for discrimination or retaliation. [Id.]. Defendant asserts that, had it fired her, it would have been for excessive absenteeism and no evidence exists indicating that the real reason was discrimination or retaliation. [Id. at 27-28].
In response, Plaintiff argues that summary judgment is not appropriate because a reasonable jury could find direct evidence of discriminatory and retaliatory intent. [Doc. 68 at 5]. Plaintiff points to Williams' statement to Plaintiff that, because Plaintiff needed another surgery, it would be best if she just resigned. [Id. at 6]. Plaintiff claims that Williams was the decisionmaker and straightforwardly terminated Plaintiff, which eliminates the need to apply the McDonnell-Douglas framework. [Id. at 5-6]. Plaintiff contends that, even if Williams denied this occurred, the evidence is sufficient to defeat summary judgment. [Id. at 7].
Next, Plaintiff argues that a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff was unlawfully terminated in retaliation for her request for accommodation. [Id.]. She contends that a jury could find that she engaged in protected activity when she requested time off to recover from her October [*17]  2018 surgery. [Id. at 8]. Plaintiff claims that, on October 15, 2018, she requested one-week off to recover from her upcoming October 29, 2018 surgery and offered to work remotely. [Id.]. Plaintiff submits that she is only alleging a request for accommodation based on this and not any earlier requests. [Id. at 8 n.3]. Plaintiff contends that Williams informed her for the first time that the position could not be performed remotely. [Id. at 8]. She argues that this evidence creates an issue as to whether she did request time off, which was a reasonable accommodation, as does Williams' email stating that Plaintiff's surgery would result in Plaintiff being out for four to six weeks without complications. [Id. at 9]. Plaintiff argues that, while she did not request a formal leave of absence, she did not testify that she did not request medical leave. [Id.]. Plaintiff contends that no magic words need to be used to request a reasonable accommodation. [Id. at 9-10].
Plaintiff also claims that her belief that her accommodation request was protected activity was objectively reasonable. [Id. at 10-11]. First, she contends that a reasonable jury could find her belief she was disabled under the [*18]  ADA to be objectively reasonable. [Id. at 11]. Her condition caused pressure inside her skull, which can cause swelling of the optic nerve and result in vision loss, and she suffered from blurred vision, forgetfulness, headaches, dizziness, and ringing in her ears. [Id. at 12]. Plaintiff admits that she testified that her condition did not limit her daily functions, but argues it was still a disability because of the impact of the surgeries and medical procedures on her limitations. [Id. at 13]. She contends that after surgeries she was required to lay down and recuperate for days or a week. [Id. at 13-14]. Next, Plaintiff argues that the Court must consider the impact of the condition if left untreated, which could lead to permanent double vision or blindness. [Id. at 14].
Second, Plaintiff argues that her belief that her request for a limited medical leave was a reasonable accommodation under the ADA was objectively reasonable. [Id. at 15]. Plaintiff contends that she requested one-week off and, although she acknowledged that she might need longer than that to heal, that did not make her request indefinite. [Id. at 15-16]. Plaintiff argues that it was Williams who suggested that Plaintiff [*19]  take a longer period to recover. [Id. at 16-17]. Plaintiff then argues that Defendant's contention that her October 15 leave request was unreasonable due to its policy against absenteeism fails because it had never disciplined her for time-off in the past. [Id. at 17]. Plaintiff also points to Williams' testimony that she had no issue granting previous leave requests and never told Plaintiff such requests were a problem. [Id. at 18].
Third, Plaintiff contends that a reasonable jury could find that her offer to work remotely was a way to partially alleviate the burden of her leave request. [Id.]. Plaintiff alleges that Jackson-Moultrie and Williams informed her during the hiring process that she could work from home as a perk of the job. [Id.]. Plaintiff argues that she sought a limited amount of leave, not an unlimited one, and also offered to perform whatever duties she could to minimize the burden on Defendant. [Id. at 18-19]. Plaintiff points to an email from August 17 in which she indicated that while on leave she could work remotely on all aspects of the position except the physical handling of medication. [Id. at 19]. She argues that her performing as many of her duties as possible [*20]  while on limited leave was a reasonable accommodation. [Id. at 19-20]. Plaintiff claims that most of the Botox Coordinator's responsibilities could be done remotely and that she never performed some of the essential functions. [Id. at 20-21]. Plaintiff contends that since limited medical leave is a reasonable accommodation, limited leave while performing duties remotely therefore must be a reasonable accommodation. [Id. at 21]. In this regard, Plaintiff argues that Jackson-Moultrie was able to take a one-week vacation after performing some preparatory work. [Id.]. Plaintiff argues that if she had been allowed to work remotely any strain on the business would have been reduced. [Id.].
Plaintiff next contends that Defendant took a materially adverse action against her when it terminated her only four days after she notified Williams of her upcoming surgery and requested an accommodation. [Id. at 22]. Plaintiff contends that a reasonable jury could find that her termination was related to her October 15 request for accommodation, because Williams herself gave the reason for attempting to force her to resign as being that she had to have another surgery. [Id.]. Plaintiff argues that even [*21]  if this is not direct evidence, it is strong circumstantial evidence. [Id. at 22-23]. Plaintiff also notes she made her accommodation request directly to Williams and was terminated just four days after her request. [Id. at 23].
Plaintiff contends that a reasonable jury could find Defendant's justifications for her termination to be pretextual. [Id.]. Plaintiff argues that a reasonable jury could find that she was terminated and did not resign because of her own testimony. [Id. at 25]. While Defendant describes this testimony as self-serving, Plaintiff argues that it creates a conflict that cannot be resolved at summary judgment. [Id. at 25-26]. Plaintiff submits that her self-serving testimony, even if uncorroborated, is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact. [Id. at 26]. She contends that such testimony is only insufficient if it is conclusory and subjective and her testimony here is based on her first-hand knowledge. [Id. at 26-27]. Further, Plaintiff argues that other evidence corroborates her account, including the fact that she was terminated only nine days before being eligible for health insurance, she gave up her badge and key and was escorted out of the building, [*22]  an internal email indicates she was terminated, and Williams filled out a form indicating Plaintiff left by mutual agreement but provided explanations consistent with attempting to justify a termination. [Id. at 28-29].
Plaintiff also argues that Defendant's evidence that Plaintiff resigned is insufficient to support summary judgment. [Id. at 29]. Plaintiff argues that Williams had a reason to hide the truth and did not actually testify that Plaintiff resigned, saying only that Plaintiff stated that she needed to take care of her health. [Id. at 29-30]. Plaintiff argues that Jackson-Moultrie's testimony is not probative because she was not at the meeting. [Id. at 30]. Further, Plaintiff argues that a reasonable jury could find that Defendant's justification for terminating her was an after-the-fact invention. [Id. at 30-31]. Plaintiff claims that Defendant is only now arguing that she could have been fired for absenteeism but that was not the justification it previously claimed. [Id. at 31]. Plaintiff contends that Defendant is undercutting its case with its shifting reasons and points out that she was never disciplined for poor attendance. [Id.].
Plaintiff then argues that she was unlawfully [*23]  terminated because of her disability or her need for a reasonable accommodation. [Id. at 32]. Plaintiff argues that she is disabled and a qualified individual under the ADA. [Id. at 33-34]. Plaintiff contends that her time off was a reasonable accommodation and Williams testified that she had no issues with her previous lengthy leave requests and tried to accommodate her in the past. [Id. at 34]. She then argues again that she requested one-week leave and also offered to alleviate the burden of that leave on Defendant by performing work remotely. [Id. at 35].
Plaintiff submits that the evidence also constitutes a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence and points to Williams' ambiguous statements, the suspicious timing of her termination, and Williams' awareness of her disability and need for accommodation. [Id. at 36-38]. Plaintiff argues that a comparator is not required when showing a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence or under the McDonnell-Douglas framework. [Id. at 38-39].
In reply, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's ADA claims fail because she cannot show she was disabled and has abandoned any claim that it regarded her as disabled. [Doc. 69 at 4]. Defendant contends [*24]  that Plaintiff has not negated her express admission that her condition did not limit any major life activities and that her testimony was stark and unequivocal. [Id.]. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's retroactive attempt to diffuse her testimony fails. [Id.]. Defendant notes that Plaintiff's doctor stated that she needed to lay down for two days after spinal taps and after spinal shunt surgery needed to lay down for about a week, but contends that the testimony was vague, non-specific, and lacked any reference to time. [Id. at 5]. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's other evidence, regulations that permit consideration of an impairment's effects without regard to ameliorative measures, is insufficient because it was only supported by Dr. Robinson's summary statements, which were also vague and speculative. [Id. at 5-6]. Defendant argues that Plaintiff has abandoned any claim that it regarded her as disabled. [Id. at 6-7].
Defendant next contends that Plaintiff failed to address irrefutable evidence that she was unqualified because she was rarely at work and identified no reasonable accommodation that would have enabled her to perform the essential functions of her job. [Id. at 7]. Defendant [*25]  argues that Plaintiff's excessive absenteeism in the first two and a half months of her employment, including at least 28 days, rendered her unqualified as a matter of law. [Id.]. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff did not address the caselaw it cited on this topic but the undisputed fact that she missed half of the workdays over her first two and a half months of employment precluded her from being a qualified individual under the ADA. [Id. at 7-9].
Defendant argues, in addition, that Plaintiff has not shown that her alleged leave requests were not indefinite and so per se unreasonable. [Id. at 9]. Defendant notes that Plaintiff submitted a declaration with her responsive briefing stating that she allegedly requested one week of medical leave in her meeting with Williams on October 15. [Id.]. First, Defendant argues that declaration is not entitled to any weight because it contradicts her sworn deposition testimony that she never knew how much time off she would need. [Id. at 10]. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's declaration implicates the sham affidavit rule. [Id. at 10 n.1]. Defendant contends that Plaintiff's assertion that her deposition testimony was a general overview and was [*26]  not asked specific follow-up questions fails because her testimony about the October 15 conversation was quite detailed and aligns with her earlier testimony. [Id. at 11].
Moreover, Defendant argues that even if Plaintiff had requested one-week leave, she was still unqualified because of all the other time she had already taken off and the fact that she would need more time off in the future. [Id. at 12]. Defendant submits that the fact that it allowed Plaintiff to take substantial time off is irrelevant, as it was not legally bound to allow her to be unreasonably absent. [Id.]. Defendant further argues that, whether she specified the amount of time she might need or not, such leave was inherently indefinite and therefore could not have been a reasonable accommodation. [Id. at 12-13].
Defendant then argues that Plaintiff's unsupported opinion is insufficient to establish that remote work was a reasonable accommodation and, specifically, that her opinion about how she might have performed the essential functions of the position is not controlling. [Id. at 13]. Relevant factors include the experience of past incumbents and whether the position exists to perform the function, among other [*27]  factors, and the evidence indicates that an in-office presence is essential. [Id. at 13-14]. Defendant argues that the fact that Jackson-Moultrie took a one-week vacation is not determinative because Jackson-Moultrie testified that she prepared in advance to be out of the office and she testified elsewhere that the position could be performed only in the office. [Id. at 14-15]. Finally, Defendant notes that Plaintiff never followed-up with Williams about working remotely during her absences and did not ever work remotely. [Id. at 15].
Defendant next argues that Plaintiff cannot show that it discriminated against her because of any disability. [Id. at 16]. Defendant notes that Plaintiff has not tried to identify a comparator and doing so is usually required. [Id.]. Defendant argues that the cases Plaintiff cites for the proposition that comparator evidence is not needed are not determinative. [Id. at 17]. Defendant also contends that Plaintiff's argument under a convincing mosaic of convincing evidence fails because it identifies no systematically better treatment of similarly situated employees. [Id. at 17-18]. Defendant also argues that, even if Williams told her to resign because [*28]  she needed surgery, that is insufficient because it demonstrates only a concern about her well-being and attendance. [Id. at 18]. Defendant argues that, in any event, allegedly biased remarks are not sufficient to establish a convincing mosaic absent evidence of pretext, which Plaintiff has not shown. [Id.].
Defendant contends that Plaintiff cannot show the requisite good faith, objectively reasonable belief that her demand for time off on October 15 comprised protected activity. [Id.]. Defendant argues that Plaintiff admitted in her deposition that her condition did not substantially limit any major life activities and her request for leave was indefinite even if she did mention needing one week. [Id. at 19]. Defendant also argues that Plaintiff cannot establish but-for causation because at the time she made any such request she had already missed at least 28 of the last 59 days. [Id. at 20]. Defendant contends that, if it terminated Plaintiff following her request for time off in mid-October, its decision would have been based on her entire attendance record and not just her last request, which Plaintiff wishes to focus on. [Id.].
Defendant argues that Plaintiff offers no evidence [*29]  of pretext and focuses on the grounds for her separation and not the reason for her separation. [Id. at 21]. Defendant argues that the only argument Plaintiff offers, that excessive absenteeism must be pretextual because it was only raised in summary judgment briefing, is nonsensical and its explanation is only awkward because it is articulating a non-discriminatory reason for a decision it did not make. [Id. at 21-22]. Defendant argues that Plaintiff does not dispute the amount of work she missed or proffer any evidence showing the real reason she was dismissed was discrimination. [Id. at 22]. Defendant contends that Plaintiff's assertion that it is offering shifting reasons is wholly baseless. [Id.].
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot avoid the many defects in her case by claiming to have direct evidence because the comments identified fall short of the exacting standard for direct evidence. [Id.]. Defendant argues the comments made by Plaintiff are not the type of blatant remarks whose intent could be nothing other than discrimination. [Id. at 23]. Defendant notes that Williams' alleged comments do not mention disability at all. [Id.].

IV. DISCUSSION
A. ADA Discrimination
1. Direct [*30]  Evidence of Discrimination
Plaintiff alleges that she was discriminated against because of her disability in violation of the ADA. [Doc. 9 at 7-10]. Plaintiff contends that she can prove her claims with direct evidence of discriminatory and retaliatory intent, and points to statements made by Williams that, because Plaintiff needed another surgery, it would be best if she just resigned. [Doc. 68 at 5-6].
The ADA prohibits "discriminat[ion] against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). To establish a case of intentional discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff may rely on direct or circumstantial evidence. Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001); Schultz v. Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd., 465 F. Supp. 3d 1232, 1262-63 (S.D. Fla. 2020). There are strict limits under Circuit precedent as to the kind of language that may be treated as direct evidence. Id. at 1265. Generally, "only the most blatant remarks, whose intent could mean nothing other than to discriminate on the basis of" some impermissible factor constitutes direct evidence of discrimination. See Rojas v. Florida, 285 F.3d 1339, 1342 n.2 (11th Cir. 2002) (quoting Schoenfeld v. Babbitt, 168 F.3d 1257, 1266 (11th Cir. 1999) (citations and quotations omitted)). "Direct evidence is [*31]  'evidence, that, if believed, proves [the] existence of [discriminatory intent] without inference or presumption.'" Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1086 (11th Cir. 2004) (first alteration in original) (quoting Burrell v. Bd. of Trs. of Ga. Military Coll., 125 F.3d 1390, 1393 (11th Cir. 1997), abrogated on other grounds by Lewis v. Union City, Ga., 918 F.3d 1213, 1218 (11th Cir. 2019) (en banc)). "Evidence . . . that is subject to more than one interpretation . . . does not constitute direct evidence." Merritt v. Dillard Paper Co., 120 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir. 1997) (citing Harris v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ., 99 F.3d 1078, 1083 n.2 (11th Cir. 1996)). "For example, a decisionmaker's blanket statement that people with a certain disability are not competent to perform a particular job would amount to direct evidence of discrimination." Bennett v. Brookdale Senior Living, Inc., No. 2:09-cv-1723, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172175, 2011 WL 13285770, at *7 (N.D. Ala. Sept. 14, 2011); see also Haynes v. W.C. Caye & Co., Inc., 52 F.3d 928, 931 (11th Cir. 1995) ("[A] statement that members of a racial minority in general or women in general are simply not competent enough to do a particular job would seem to be a classic example of direct evidence [of discriminatory intent]").
Plaintiff's proof does not satisfy the requirements for direct evidence of discrimination. Williams' statement that if she was having another surgery she should just resign does not satisfy this stringent test. Plaintiff does not allege that Williams told her that she was being terminated or could not perform her job because of her PTC or, more generally, because of her alleged disability. [Doc. 68 at 5-6]; see Bennett, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172175, 2011 WL 13285770, at *7. There also is more than one interpretation of [*32]  Williams' remark, that is, as Defendant argues, even if Williams made such a statement, she was only indicating a concern for Plaintiff's well-being, and therefore does not reflect an intent that is nothing other than to discriminate on the basis of disability. [Doc. 69 at 22-23]; Rojas, 285 F.3d at 1342 n.2. As a result, to survive summary judgment, Plaintiff's ADA claims must satisfy the circumstantial evidence of discrimination standard.
2. Circumstantial Evidence of Discrimination
If a plaintiff attempts to prove an employer's intentional discrimination through circumstantial evidence, the familiar burden-shifting framework laid out in McDonnell-Douglas 17 applies. Collier v. Harland Clarke Corp., 820 Fed. Appx. 874, 878 (11th Cir. July 8, 2020) (citing Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir. 2007) (explaining that the "burden-shifting analysis of Title VII employment discrimination claims is applicable to ADA claims")). "To establish a prima facie case for disability discrimination, a plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence to permit a jury to find that she: (1) is disabled, (2) is a qualified individual, and (3) was discriminated against because of her disability." Lewis, 934 F.3d at 1179. Plaintiff has the burden of making this showing by a preponderance of the evidence. Schultz, 465 F. Supp. 3d at 1264. Once such a showing is made, the defendant has the burden of articulating a [*33]  legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its employment action. Pennington v. City of Huntsville, 261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir. 2001); Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., 196 F.3d 1354, 1359-61 (11th Cir. 1999). This burden is "exceedingly light." Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1564 (11th Cir. 1997). "[T]he defendant must merely proffer non-[discriminatory] based reasons, not prove them." Meeks v. Computer Assocs. Int'l., 15 F.3d 1013, 1019 (11th Cir. 1994); see also Kragor v. Takeda Pharm. Am., Inc., 702 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir. 2012) (burden is one of "production, not persuasion" and employer need only present evidence raising a genuine issue of fact). That is, the employer must only introduce admissible evidence to support the challenged employment actions. Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254-55, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). "Although this burden is not onerous, . . . neither is it a mere formality." Walker v. Mortham, 158 F.3d 1177, 1184 (11th Cir. 1998) (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253). At this stage, a defendant-employer must:
clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, the reason for its adverse employment decision, and that reason must be legally sufficient to justify a judgment for the defendant.
Id. (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253). The Court recognizes that the Eleventh Circuit has held that there must be "evidence that asserted reasons for discharge were actually relied on or the reasons are not sufficient to meet defendant's rebuttal burden," IMPACT v. Firestone, 893 F.2d 1189, 1194 (11th Cir. 1990) (quoting Lee v. Russell County Bd. of Educ., 684 F.2d 769, 775 (11th Cir. 1982)). However, the Supreme Court in Burdine expressly stated that "defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons." 450 U.S. at 254.
If the defendant meets this [*34]  light burden, then the inference of discrimination is rebutted, and the inquiry "proceeds to a new level of specificity in which the plaintiff must show that the proffered reason really is a pretext for unlawful discrimination." Brooks v. County Comm'n of Jefferson County, Ala., 446 F.3d 1160, 1162 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting E.E.O.C. v. Joe's Stone Crabs, Inc., 296 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir. 2002)); Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1565; see also Martin v. Brevard Cty. Public Schs., 543 F.3d 1261, 1268 (11th Cir. 2008) (describing a plaintiff's burden as demonstrating that the employer's proffered reason was pretextual by presenting evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reason for the adverse employment decision). At this stage, to survive summary judgment, the plaintiff "must introduce significantly probative evidence showing that the asserted reason is merely a pretext." Brooks, 446 F.3d at 1163. "If the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, the plaintiff must meet it head on and rebut it instead of merely quarreling with it. Wilson, 376 F.3d at 1088 (citation omitted). The inquiry here "is limited to whether the employer gave an honest explanation of its behavior." Kragor, 702 F.3d at 1310-11 (quoting Elrod v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 939 F.2d 1466, 1470 (11th Cir. 1991)). The Court cannot second guess the employer's business judgment or inquire as to whether its decision here was "prudent or fair." See Damon, 196 F.3d at 1361.
Despite this burden-shifting framework, the "ultimate burden of persuading [*35]  the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff." Wilson, 376 F.3d at 1088 (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253).
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff cannot establish the prima facie elements of her claim and, even if she could, her claim would fail for lack of evidence of pretext. [See Doc. 45-1 at 5-6]. First, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not proven that she is disabled for purposes of the ADA. [Id. at 6-10].18 Plaintiff testified that prior to her surgery she suffered from ringing in her ears, foggy vision, headaches, forgetfulness, and dizziness, but that she had learned to live with it and that it did not prevent her from doing anything she was otherwise able to do, including driving, picking up her mother, and cooking. [See D ¶¶ 13-14].
The ADA protects individuals who are actually disabled, in that they have "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities," who have a "record of such impairment," or who are "regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). Major life activities include performing manual tasks, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, concentrating, thinking, communicating, [*36]  and working. Id. § 12102(2)(A). Therefore, based on Plaintiff's own testimony, she does not appear to have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).
Plaintiff arguments to the contrary are rejected. First, Plaintiff argues that she was substantially limited in major life activities during her recovery periods following her surgeries, which qualifies as a disability. [Doc. 68 at 13]. Plaintiff cites Young v. McCarthy-Bush Corp., No. 1:12-CV-3623-RWS, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38084, 2014 WL 1224459, at *5 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 24, 2014), in which the court found that the plaintiff was disabled even though her knee replacement surgery was a temporary impairment, because her major life activities, such as walking and bathing, were significantly limited while she recovered. Plaintiff argues that after each of her medical procedures she was required to lay down and recuperate for days or weeks and was therefore limited in her major life activities. [Doc. 68 at 13-14]. As evidentiary support, Plaintiff cites to Dr. Robinson's declaration, which stated that Plaintiff needed to lay down for approximately two days to recover from a spinal tap and a week to recover from a spinal surgery. [P ¶ 11; see also 53-8 at 6 (Robinson Decl.)]. However, Dr. Robinson's declaration does not discuss any [*37]  specific absences Plaintiff took while working with Defendant and, in fact, is not even tied to the time that Plaintiff was employed with Defendant. [See Doc. 53-8 at 6]. Notably, Plaintiff had nine surgeries over the course of 15 months, but only worked for Defendant for roughly two and a half months, so many of the occasions to which Dr. Robinson referred presumably occurred before or after Plaintiff's employment. [D ¶¶ 1, 15, 55]. While the Court must infer disputed facts in favor of Plaintiff, it is not authorized to speculate or create facts that are not in the record. In addition, many of the absences Plaintiff did take while working for Defendant were not for a period of two days or one week, that is, the length of time Dr. Robinson indicated she would need to recover from either spinal taps (two days) or after spinal shunt surgery ("usually lay down . . . for one week"), [Doc. 53-8 at 6]. [See, e.g., D ¶¶ 41-42, 46 (absent from August 21, 2018 to September 4, 2018); D ¶ 48 (absent from September 5, 2018 until September 24, 2018)]. Furthermore, Dr. Robinson did not indicate that during recovery Plaintiff was limited in her major life activities,19 as the record reflected in Young [*38] , and thus this case is much more like Butler v. BTC Foods Inc., No. CIV.A. 12-492, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151582, 2012 WL 5315034, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 19, 2012), where the court recognized that "an employee's inability to work for a period after recovering from surgery does not necessarily support a finding that Plaintiff has a disability under the ADA." Cf. Sutton v. Lader, 185 F.3d 1203, 1209 (11th Cir. 1999) (holding that "temporary inability to work while recuperating from surgery does not constitute" a disability for purposes of the Rehabilitation Act).20
Therefore, the Court is left to speculate as to which absences the evidence cited by Plaintiff is referring and, as to other absences, whether Plaintiff was limited in her major life activities. Facts, not speculation or conjecture, are required to defeat a motion for summary judgment. See Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1181 (11th Cir. 2005) ("Speculation does not create a genuine issue of fact; instead, it creates a false issue, the demolition of which is a primary goal of summary judgment").
Plaintiff's second argument is that the Court is required to consider the impact on Plaintiff if her PTC was left untreated. [Doc. 68 at 14]. Courts are required to inquire whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity "without regard to ameliorative effects of mitigating measures." Lloyd v. Hous. Auth. of the City of Montgomery, Ala., 857 F. Supp. 2d 1252, 1263 (M.D. Ala. 2012) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(E)(i)). The court in Lloyd noted, however, that the plaintiff [*39]  still "bears the burden of producing evidence about how his condition would affect him if left untreated . . . [a] contrary rule would require courts to gaze into a crystal ball, put on a white coat, and divine how a given impairment would have affected the plaintiff had he decided to leave it untreated." Id. Notably, the Lloyd court found that the plaintiff had failed to produce evidence tending to prove how his impairments would have affected him in a hypothetical untreated state during the relevant time, prior to a later transfer. Id. at 1263-64.
Here, Plaintiff points to a statement by Dr. Robinson that PTC, if left untreated, "could lead to permanent double vision or even blindness." [P ¶ 8; see also Doc. 53-8 at 5 (Robinson Decl.)]. However, the Court finds that this statement is too vague and speculative to create an issue of triable fact. As indicated in Lloyd, the relevant issue is whether remaining untreated would have rendered Plaintiff disabled during the period she was working with Defendant. Lloyd, 857 F. Supp. 2d at 1263-64. Assuming double vision and/or blindness would occur, which Dr. Robinson only notes as a possibility, his declaration is silent as to whether that would have happened within the time of Plaintiff's [*40]  employment or months, years, or decades later. The Court is therefore left to guess as to how Plaintiff would have been affected in the relevant time period. Id. at 1263. The Court finds that Plaintiff has therefore failed to meet her burden.
Especially given Plaintiff's own testimony, the undersigned recommends a finding that Plaintiff is not disabled for purposes of the ADA. The undersigned continues the McDonnell-Douglas analysis, however, in case the District Judge disagrees with the conclusions just reached.
Second, Defendant argues that, even if Plaintiff was disabled, she was not qualified to work in the Botox Coordinator position because of her absences. [Doc. 45-1 at 10-12]. Plaintiff responds that she was qualified in that she asked for a reasonable accommodation in the form of leaves of definite duration. [Doc. 68 at 15-17]. Plaintiff further argues that allowing her time to recover enabled her to perform her job in the immediate future and she was never previously disciplined for poor attendance. [Id. at 17-18].
The ADA provides that "no covered employer shall discriminate against 'a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual' in any of the 'terms, [*41]  conditions or privileges of employment.'" Morisky v. Broward County, 80 F.3d 445, 447 (11th Cir. 1996) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). A "qualified individual with a disability" means a person "with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1235 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)). Phrased another way, an accommodation is only reasonable if it will allow the employee to perform the essential functions of the job. Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000). "What constitutes a reasonable accommodation depends on the circumstances, but it may include . . . part-time or modified work schedules . . . among other things." Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2016).
In Jackson v. Veterans Administration, 22 F.3d 277, 278-79 (11th Cir. 1994), the plaintiff was terminated from his temporary, probationary appointment as a housekeeping aide at a hospital after missing six days over a roughly two-and-a-half-month period. He challenged his termination under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Id. at 279. The VA admitted that the plaintiff satisfied the requirements of his position when at work but argued that presence on a routine basis was an essential element of his job. Id. at 278. The plaintiff, in turn, argued that he could have satisfied this requirement with some accommodation, in particular, he sought one day off every two weeks to receive treatment for his arthritis and the opportunity [*42]  to swap work days, delays of his work time, or deferring the physically demanding aspects of his position if he suffered a flare up. Id. at 279. The Jackson court held that, under the circumstances of that case, there was no reasonable accommodation for the employee's numerous unpredictable absences in the first few months of his work as a temporary employee. Id.; see also Robinson v. Fulton Cty., Ga., No. 105CV-2250-RWS, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 560, 2008 WL 78711, at *22 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 4, 2008) ("Courts have consistently held that the ability to be present on the job and to complete all assigned tasks within a reasonable period of time is essential to any job"); Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F. Supp. 931, 946 (N.D. Ga. 1995) (Hull, J.) (stating that a claimant could not perform the essential functions of her job because she could not "maintain a regular and reliable level of attendance at her job"). The Jackson court further recognized that having the plaintiff's work done by other employees posed an undue burden on the employer. Jackson, 22 F.3d at 279.
In Meade v. General Motors LLC, 317 F. Supp. 3d 1259, 1263 (N.D. Ga. 2018) (Totenberg, J.), the plaintiff suffered from migraines and depression and, while working for the defendant over a period of about two years, took several months paid disability leave and intermittent leave under the Family Medical Leave Act. She missed approximately 152 days in one year. Id. at 1264. The employer argued that the plaintiff was not a qualified individual under the [*43]  ADA because her absenteeism caused her work to be unsatisfactory. Id. at 1274. She responded that she could perform the essential functions of the job with a reasonable accommodation, namely, medical leave of definite duration. Id. The plaintiff also submitted that she had not been previously disciplined for her absences, her previous leave requests had been granted, her supervisor regularly reassigned work to other employees, and that her deadlines were normally flexible. Id. at 1275. She also testified that her job was somewhat flexible, and she was allowed to work remotely at times. Id. Relying in part on Jackson, the Meade court found that the plaintiff had not met her burden of showing that her request for leave was reasonable and stressed that it was undisputed that "Plaintiff missed roughly half of the total work days" in the relevant period. Id. at 1276-77 (emphasis in original). The court also noted that the plaintiff had not presented any evidence that her situation would improve after returning from her latest request for leave. Id. at 1277.
The present case is analogous to Jackson and Meade, and as a result, due to Plaintiff's absenteeism, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff is a qualified [*44]  individual. Plaintiff was absent nearly half the time that she worked for Defendant, essential functions of her job required that she be physically present, her absence resulted in Defendant having other employees perform her job, and her leave request, even if of definite duration, did not include any prediction that her situation would improve after leave. Thus, summary judgment is warranted as to whether Plaintiff was a qualified individual under the ADA.
As to the "reasonable accommodation" prong of Plaintiff's ADA discrimination claim, Defendant argues that Plaintiff never, in fact, requested a reasonable accommodation because she asked for remote work as an accommodation for her disability. [Doc. 45-1 at 13]. The law of this Circuit is that the duty to provide an accommodation is triggered only if a specific demand for accommodation is made. U.S. v. Hialeah Housing Authority, 418 Fed. Appx. 872, 876 (11th Cir. Mar. 22, 2011) (citing Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir. 1999); Wood v. Pres. & Trs. of Spring Hill College in the City of Mobile, 978 F.2d 1214, 1222 (11th Cir. 1992)). The request for accommodation must also be direct, specific, and identify how it is linked to a disability. Stanley v. Lockheed Martin Corp., No. 6:11-cv-1649, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108145, 2013 WL 3974655, at *11 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 1, 2013) (citing United States v. Hialeah Housing Authority, 418 Fed. Appx. 872, 876 (11th Cir. Mar. 22, 2011), and Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island, 544 F.3d 1201, 1219 (11th Cir. 2008) ("[T]he duty to make a reasonable accommodation does not simply spring from the fact that the handicapped person wants such an accommodation made. Defendants must instead have . . . the ability to conduct [*45]  a meaningful review of the requested accommodation")).
In the present case, the evidence reflects that Plaintiff testified she was told by Jackson-Moultrie that she could "do remote," [D ¶ 20], and that she offered to perform work remotely when she had to be away from work for medical reasons, [P ¶ 22]. Moreover, the facts viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff indicate that when Plaintiff offered to work remotely she was told that someone else would cover her work instead. [P ¶ 41; DRP ¶ 41]. The fact that she did not ultimately work remotely does not alter the fact that the facts indicate that she offered to do so. The Court therefore finds that Plaintiff did request an accommodation. The Court also concludes that on October 15, 2018 Plaintiff requested one-week of leave to recover from a surgery at the end of the month. [P ¶ 43; DRP ¶ 43].
However, the undisputed facts viewed in Plaintiff's favor also demonstrate that the accommodation request was not reasonable. Specifically, the Court notes that during the relatively brief two-and-a-half-month period that Plaintiff worked with Defendant, she missed almost half of her normal workdays. [D ¶ 56; PRD ¶ 56]. The ability to be [*46]  present on the job and complete all assigned tasks within a reasonable period is essential to any position, but certainly to the position of Botox Coordinator. Jackson, 22 F.3d at 279; Robinson, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 560, 2008 WL 78711, at *22; Lewis, 908 F. Supp. at 946.
Meade, which relied on Jackson, is both instructive and persuasive.21 In Meade, as in the present matter, the plaintiff missed roughly half of the days she was meant to work. [Compare D ¶ 56 & PRD ¶ 56, with Meade, 317 F. Supp. 3d at 1264].22 In Meade, one of the issues raised was whether the plaintiff was a qualified individual under the ADA. Meade, 317 F. Supp. 3d at 1263-64. Indeed, as here, the Meade plaintiff argued that she had not been disciplined for her prior absences, which had been granted, that her supervisor was able to reassign her work to others, and that she was able to work remotely at times. [Compare id. at 1274-75, with Doc. 68 at 31, 34]. In rejecting these arguments, the Meade court underscored the number of absences, with the plaintiff missing roughly half of her total workdays. Meade, 317 F. Supp. 3d at 1274-75. In concluding that the plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation, namely, medical leave of definite duration, the Meade court explained that there was no evidence that the plaintiff's situation would have improved after returning from her [*47]  latest request for leave. Id. at 1277. Similarly, there is no evidence in the instant case that Plaintiff's absences would have abated or stopped if she continued her employment with Defendant after her termination on October 19, 2018, since she continued having surgeries until September 2019, [D ¶ 15]. In short, regular and reliable attendance is required for an employee to perform the essential functions of a job, Lewis, 908 F. Supp. at 946, and Plaintiff has not made such a showing here that the accommodation she sought was reasonable.
In response, Plaintiff focuses on the one-week of leave she sought during her October 15 meeting with Jackson-Moultrie, arguing that that leave was reasonable because it was definite. [Doc. 68 at 15-16]. However, Plaintiff's repetitive absences that amounted to almost half of her tenure with Defendant, even if short and of limited duration (although some were not), is not a reasonable accommodation. "The plaintiff bears the burden of identifying an accommodation, and of demonstrating that the accommodation allows h[er] to perform the job's essential functions." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted); see also Santandreu v. Miami Dade Cty., 513 Fed. Appx. 902, 905 (11th Cir. Mar. 21, 2013) ("While a leave of absence may be a reasonable accommodation, [*48]  the ADA does not require an employer to provide leave for an indefinite period of time because an employee is uncertain about the duration of his condition."). The Court finds that Plaintiff's claims still fail because her attendance was not regular and reliable as required by Jackson and other cases. See, e.g., Lewis, 908 F. Supp. at 946.
Plaintiff contends that her request was for a one-week leave of absence and her prior requests for leave should not be considered, citing Coker v. Enhanced Senior Living, Inc., 897 F. Supp. 2d 1366, 1379 (N.D. Ga. 2012); [see also P ¶ 26]. However, in Coker, the employee disputed eleven of the twelve absences specifically identified by the employer by challenging either the nature of her absence or the fact of her being absent. Id. The Coker court viewed these facts as required in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and concluded that an issue of triable fact existed with regard to her absenteeism. Id. In the present case there is no dispute as to the number of absences. The record reflects that Plaintiff missed four days in her first two weeks, [D ¶¶ 38, 40], was at work each day of her third week, but was then out of the office from August 21 to September 4, 2018, [D ¶¶ 41-42, 46]. Following her return on September 4, 2018, she submitted a doctor's [*49]  note on September 5, 2018 requesting additional leave and did not return to work until September 24, 2018. [D ¶¶ 48, 52]. The week she returned, Plaintiff worked every day except Thursday, [D ¶ 52], worked the next two weeks, except for the first Friday, when she worked a half day, and the second Friday, October 12, 2020, which she took off. [D ¶ 53]. The next week, Plaintiff worked Monday and Tuesday, was off Wednesday and Thursday, and was terminated on Friday, October 19. [D ¶¶ 54-55]. The Court further notes that Plaintiff apparently underwent multiple additional surgeries for a year after her termination, [D ¶ 15, D ¶ 55], when her condition was finally resolved, and Plaintiff has offered no evidence that she would not have required more absences from work in the interim.23 Therefore, Coker does not counsel a different result than the one reached by the Court.
Plaintiff's case is in some respects akin to that presented in Wood v. Green, 323 F.3d 1309 (11th Cir. 2003). Although distinguishable because in that case the plaintiff was seeking leave of somewhat unlimited duration, similar to the present case, there was no indication that the plaintiff's need for leave would be resolved by the latest accommodation:
While [*50]  a leave of absence might be a reasonable accommodation in some cases, Wood was requesting an indefinite leave of absence. Wood might return to work within a month or two, or he could be stricken with another cluster headache soon after his return and require another indefinite leave of absence. Wood was not requesting an accommodation that allowed him to continue work in the present, but rather, in the future — at some indefinite time.
Id. at 1314; cf. J.A.M. v. Nova Se. Univ., Inc., 646 Fed. Appx. 921, 925 (11th Cir. Apr. 6, 2016) (university under no obligation to grant plaintiff's requested accommodations—repeated medical leaves of absence for extended amounts of time, exam rescheduling, and excusal of misconduct).
The Court concludes that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to her record of attendance being regular or reliable. See, e.g., Jackson, 22 F.3d at 279; Lewis, 908 F. Supp. at 946.
Next, Plaintiff argues that she offered to work remotely as a way to partially alleviate the burden of her leave request. [Doc. 68 at 18-21; D ¶ 20; P ¶¶ 22, 41; DRP ¶ 41]. However, having already found that regular and reliable attendance was required for Plaintiff to perform the essential functions of her job, Lewis, 908 F. Supp. at 946, and that Plaintiff's attendance did not meet this standard in the relatively brief period of time that she worked [*51]  for Defendant, the Court does not address this issue at length.
"Essential functions" are "the fundamental job duties of the employment position," but do "not include the marginal functions of the position." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1); see also Samson v. Fed. Exp. Corp., 746 F.3d 1196, 1200 (11th Cir. 2014). An employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential is a factor to be considered. D'Angelo, 422 F.3d at 1230. Consideration is also given to be given to a written description of the position created prior to advertising or interviewing applicants for the job. Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)). Other relevant factors include "(1) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, (2) the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function, (3) the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, (4) the work experience of past incumbents in the job, and (5) the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs." Id. (citing Davis v. Florida Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3))).
An accommodation is only reasonable if it would allow the employee to perform the essential functions of the position. Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365. The Eleventh Circuit has recognized that the ADA does not require an employer in the course of reasonably accommodating an employee with a disability to change the essential functions of the position:
An employer is not required [*52]  to re-allocate job duties in order to change the essential function of the job or remove another employee from a position in order to accommodate a disabled employee. . . . An employer may be required to restructure a particular job by altering or eliminating marginal functions, but an employer is not required to transform a position into another one by eliminating essential functions.
Bagwell v. Morgan Cty. Comm'n, 676 Fed. Appx. 863, 866 (11th Cir. Jan. 18, 2017) (citations omitted). Courts have cautioned that "[w]hether a particular job function is essential is 'evaluated on a case-by-case basis by examining a number of factors' " and that "the question of whether a job function is essential is generally not suitable for resolution on a motion for summary judgment." Jernigan v. Bellsouth Telecomms., 17 F. Supp. 3d 1317, 1322 (N.D. Ga. 2014) (Totenberg, J.) (quoting and citing Samson, 746 F.3d 1200-01).
The parties agree that the essential functions of the Botox Coordinator position included keeping inventory of Botox stock and ensuring the practice has enough Botox in stock for cosmetic and medical uses. [D ¶ 16]. The parties further agree that Defendant receives several shipments of Botox a week and sometimes receives multiple shipments in a day. [D ¶ 18]. Plaintiff admits that she could not perform this essential function while on leave, even if working [*53]  remotely. [Doc. 68 at 20]. Under relevant caselaw, the ADA does not require a Defendant to eliminate even one essential function of a position. Davis, 205 F.3d at 1305.
Plaintiff points out that unpacking and putting shipments in the refrigerator took only two to three minutes, [D ¶ 18, DRP ¶ 18], and argues that she could perform the other essential functions remotely, [Doc. 68 at 19-20].24 But the undisputed facts reflect that taking inventory of the Botox took an additional 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the day. [P ¶ 38; DRP ¶ 38]. Despite Plaintiff's attempts to minimize the importance of these responsibilities, one factor to be considered is the employer's judgment, and the Defendant here has identified these functions as essential. D'Angelo, 422 F.3d at 1230.
Other factors to be considered include the amount of time spent on the function and the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform them. Id. While Plaintiff again minimizes these functions, the record demonstrates that, while each day the amount of time needed to unpack and inventory Botox shipments was modest, and so the burden on others was modest, the cumulative impact is substantial. The record further is undisputed that because these duties had to [*54]  be performed for the proper operation of Defendant's business, the consequence of not requiring Plaintiff to perform these duties is that they had to be performed by others who were, presumably, already working full-time and had other responsibilities. The Court does note that the possibility of remote work was raised and rejected by the Court in Meade. See Meade, 317 F. Supp. 3d at 1274-75.
Finally, the Court recognizes that although Jackson-Moultrie testified at her deposition that the Botox Coordinator position could not be done remotely, [D ¶ 32], she told Plaintiff at the time she was hired that she could "do remote," [D ¶ 20]. Drawing all factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Four Parcels of Real Prop., 941 F.2d at 1437, the Court finds this factor could favor Plaintiff's position. However, having admitted that unpacking and inventorying Botox shipments were essential functions of the Botox Coordinator and that these functions could not be performed remotely, there is no genuine issue of material fact that working remotely was not a reasonable accommodation for that position.25
Third, Defendant argues that there is no genuine fact issue regarding whether Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action. [Doc. 45-1 at 21-22, [*55]  25-26]. Drawing all factual inferences in Plaintiff's favor, the Court concludes that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Plaintiff was terminated. [P ¶ 47].
Alternatively, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot show that she was terminated because of her disability and that Plaintiff cannot show that Defendant treated any similarly situated employees outside of Plaintiff's protected class more favorably. [Doc. 45-1 at 22-23]. Indeed, Plaintiff does not attempt to identify any similarly situated employees. [See generally Doc. 68]. Instead, Plaintiff argues that making such a showing is unnecessary and that she need only show a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that she was subject to disability discrimination. [Doc. 68 at 39].
The identity of a comparator is not a necessary element to establish a prima facie case of ADA discrimination; it is only one way of proving discriminatory intent. Sugg v. City of Sunrise, No. 19-CV-62866, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 186282, 2020 WL 6193514, at *6 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 6, 2020) (citing Hargett v. Fla. Atl. Univ. Bd. of Trustees, 219 F. Supp. 3d 1227, 1242 n.17 (S.D. Fla. 2016)). Even without a proper comparator, "[a] triable issue of fact exists if the record, viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff[s], presents 'a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer intentional discrimination by the [*56]  decisionmaker.' " Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011) (quoting Silverman v. Bd. of Educ., 637 F.3d 729, 734 (7th Cir. 2011), overruled by Ortiz v. Werner Enters., Inc., 834 F.3d 760 (7th Cir. 2016) (footnote omitted))). What counts as convincing circumstantial evidence is "flexible and depend[s] on the particular situation." Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., 610 F.3d 1253, 1264 (11th Cir. 2010). A convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence allowing the inference of discrimination may be shown by suspicious timing, ambiguous statements, and other bits and pieces from which an inference of discriminatory intent may be drawn; systemically better treatment of similarly situated employees; and that an employer's justification is pretextual. Lewis, 934 F.3d at 1185; see also Williams v. Hous. Auth. of Savannah, Inc., 834 Fed. Appx. 482, 2020 WL 6335946, at *4 (11th Cir. 2020).
Plaintiff claims that there is suspicious timing in that she was fired four days after her request for accommodation on October 15. [Doc. 68 at 37]. The Court's research has located no Eleventh Circuit cases outside the context of retaliatory discrimination that elaborate on the suspicious-timing factor in the applying the convincing-mosaic discrimination paradigm. Several district court cases in this Circuit have applied it. For example, in Schultz v. Metro Truck Rental, Inc., No. 2:18-cv-1598, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 229135, 2020 WL 7211162, *6 (N.D. Ala. Dec. 7, 2020), the court found that the employer reduced the plaintiff's work duties and hours shortly after he underwent hip surgery and around the same time that its CEO formed the belief that the plaintiff physically could not get [*57]  out of his chair, and shortly before the defendant's CFO encourage the plaintiff to "consider disability" and apply for social security or unemployment benefits. The court went on to find that the suspicious timing of the events prevented summary judgment:
These bits and pieces of evidence are the kinds of "suspicious timing[s]" and "ambiguous statements" that can support an inference of discrimination. Lewis, 934 F.3d at 1185. See generally Norris v. GKN Westland Aerospace, Inc., 921 F. Supp. 2d 1308 (M.D. Ala. 2013) (holding that employer who transferred employee following discussion of employee's medical conditions while other employees were not transferred created circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent).
Now, a jury might find this evidence is just a series of coincidences. And a jury might agree with Metro that Schultz was simply a poor worker, so Metro was justified in limiting Schultz's duties and hours. But Metro does little to convince the court that its version of events is undisputed, leaving a jury with no choice but to vote Metro's way.
Id.; see also Cogar v. Prendergast, No. 518CV52OCJSMPRL, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 224057, 2019 WL 7484076, at *10 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 20, 2019) (finding suspicious timing in gender discrimination case, including obscene and inflammatory text messages, objections to her rehire, and misogynistic comments about her appearance and how she advanced her career), [*58]  report and recommendation adopted sub nom. Cogar v. Citrus Cty. Sheriff's Office, No. 5:18-CV-52-OC-30PRL, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1345, 2020 WL 60182 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 6, 2020). Another court outside of this Circuit denied summary judgment where there was suspicious timing of statements or comments that had "come out of the blue." See Singh v. Am. Ass'n of Retired Persons, Inc., 456 F. Supp. 3d 1, 10 (D.D.C. 2020) (where plaintiff described comments as "totally out of context and deliberate").
Nonetheless, the convincing-mosaic method of establishing an employer's discriminatory intent is not a substitute for an ADA plaintiff's burden to demonstrate a triable fact issue as to her being covered by the ADA, i.e., being a "qualified individual." As the court recognized in McGhee v. PPG Indus., Inc., Case No. 4:18-CV-244 (CDL), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58832, 2020 WL 1669849 (M.D. Ga. Apr. 3, 2020), appeal dismissed, No. 20-12570-AA, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 29092, 2020 WL 6018756 (11th Cir. Sept. 14, 2020), even using the convincing-mosaic theory, the plaintiff still must show that she is a "qualified individual":
McGhee argues that, even if he is not a qualified individual, his ADA claims should still survive summary judgment because he points to "a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer" PPG engaged in intentional disability discrimination. Smith, 644 F.3d at 1328. But, McGhee makes no attempt to explain how this "convincing mosaic" framework (a method of proving intentional discrimination) would somehow allow an otherwise unqualified individual to bring an ADA claim. The text of the ADA clearly [*59]  states that it only applies to intentional discrimination against "qualified individual[s]." See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a) (emphasis added) ("No covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability. . . ."). Because McGhee has not shown that he is a qualified individual (e.g., that he is able to perform the essential functions of his position with or without accommodation), the ADA does not apply to him regardless of whether he can otherwise show intentional discrimination via a "convincing mosaic" of circumstantial evidence.
McGhee, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58832, 2020 WL 1669849 at *9. As noted previously, given the frequency and number of Plaintiff's absences and her resultant inability to perform some of the essential functions of her position as Botox Coordinator, such as inventorying the Botox, rendering her outside the protections of the ADA, the suspicious-timing element of the convincing-mosaic method does not enable her to avoid summary judgment. See also Chapman v. Alabama, No. 7:17-cv-01631-LSC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 179769, 2019 WL 5265329, at *7 (N.D. Ala. Oct. 17, 2019) ("And for the same reasons that Chapman has failed to show that she was qualified for the TT classification, the Court further finds that she has failed to present a "convincing mosaic" sufficient to withstand summary judgment.").
Finally, in furtherance of the convincing-mosaic [*60]  framework, Plaintiff points to Williams' statement that "because you have to have surgery, it's best that you just resign . . . if you don't resign, I'm going to have to fire you." [P ¶ 47]. Viewing this statement in Plaintiff's favor, this statement is much more probative on the issue of intent. Nonetheless, as held in McGhee and concluded above regarding Plaintiff's suspicious-timing evidence, the employer's remark, even if reflecting on its discriminatory intent, cannot serve to resuscitate Plaintiff's otherwise deficient ADA discrimination claim.
Regardless, as noted by Defendant, allegedly bias remarks are not sufficient to establish a convincing mosaic absent probative evidence of pretext. Melvin v. Fed. Express Corp., 814 Fed. Appx. 506, 513 (11th Cir. May 21, 2020). The Court therefore turns to that issue.
Defendant argues that, although it did not terminate Plaintiff's employment, a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for her termination existed in the form of her excessive absences. [Doc. 45-1 at 27]. In response, Plaintiff argues that a reasonable jury could find Defendant's justification for her termination was pretext. [Doc. 68 at 23]. She contends that a reasonable jury could find that she was terminated and did not resign and that when a court [*61]  is confronted with cases in which there is a disagreement about how a claimant's employment ended, the case cannot be resolved at summary judgment. [Id. at 25-26]. Plaintiff then argues that the fact that her testimony is self-serving is not determinative, it was, in fact, corroborated, and Defendant's evidence to the contrary is insufficient. [Id. at 26-30]. Plaintiff argues that a reasonable jury could find Defendant's newfound justification for terminating Plaintiff to be a post-hoc invention and that Defendant had not raised this issue until its summary judgment brief, making it irrelevant, and the shifting reasons offered for her termination created an issue of credibility making summary judgment inappropriate. [Id. at 30-31]. Finally, Plaintiff points out that she was not previously punished for her poor attendance. [Id. at 31].
Pretext means that the reason given by an employer is not the reason for an adverse employment action; in other words, a plaintiff must show both that the reason given was false and that the real reason was discrimination. Gilliard v. Ga. Dep't of Corrs., 500 Fed. Appx. 860, 864-65 (11th Cir. Dec. 7, 2012). A plaintiff must meet the proffered reason directly and rebut it and may not success by arguing about the wisdom of the reason.  [*62] Id. (citing Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1030, (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc)). A plaintiff can withstand summary judgment by showing "such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." Id. (quoting Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir. 1997)).
The Court concludes that Plaintiff has not met Defendant's argument that it could have terminated her employment for excessive absenteeism within the first two and a half months of her employment, while on a probationary period, and rebutted it head on. Gilliard, 500 Fed. Appx. at 864-65. Instead, Plaintiff argues that because Defendant has argued it did not terminate her, it may not now argue that it had the right to do so. First, this argument misapprehends Defendant's position, as Defendant continues to contend that Plaintiff resigned. [See Doc. 69 at 21 ("Defendant stands by its contention that Plaintiff resigned voluntarily . . . .")]. Defendant therefore has not proffered shifting reasons as to her termination.
More importantly, when a defendant produces a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its actions, it does not "need to persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons." Beatty v. Hudco Industrial Products, Inc., 881 F. Supp. 2d 1344, 1353 (N.D. Ala. 2012) (citing [*63]  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254-55) (quotations omitted). Plaintiff's argument regarding Defendant's alleged switch in tactics is therefore unpersuasive.26,27
Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not shown either that the legitimate, non-discriminatory reason given for her termination—the amount of days missed—was false or that the real reason was discrimination. Gilliard, 500 Fed. Appx. at 864-65. Plaintiff does not dispute that an employee missing roughly half of their scheduled workdays would be a legitimate reason for terminating her, nor does she dispute that she in fact missed the days that Defendant claims she did. Having failed to raise any arguments on the issue, Plaintiff has also failed to identify weaknesses, implausibilities, or inconsistencies, sufficient to render the explanation unworthy of credence. Id.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's ADA discrimination claim.
B. ADA Retaliation
Plaintiff also alleges retaliation under the ADA. [Doc. 9 at 7-10]. The ADA provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA] or because such individual made [*64]  a charge . . . under the [ADA]." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). In order to state a retaliation claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that: "(1) [s]he engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) [s]he suffered an action from [her] employer that a reasonable employee would have found to be materially adverse; and (3) there is a causal link between the two events." Bothwell v. RMC Ewell, Inc., 278 Fed. Appx. 948, 952 (11th Cir. May 21, 2008) (citing Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006)).
If the Plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the Defendant employer to come forward with a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the action that negates the inference of discrimination. Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997); see also Woodruff v. Sch. Bd. of Seminole Cty., Fla., 304 Fed. Appx. 795, 798 (11th Cir. Dec. 19, 2008) (citing Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1260). A defendant need not persuade the court that the proffered reasons actually motivated it and only has the burden of production. Id. (citing Wascura, 257 F.3d at 1242). If the burden is carried, the plaintiff must establish that the proffered reason was pretextual. Id.
The Eleventh Circuit has yet to decide in a published decision whether retaliation claims can survive summary judgment under a convincing-mosaic theory. Compare James v. City of Montgomery, 823 Fed. Appx. 728, 735 (11th Cir. Aug. 4, 2020) ("[a]ssuming, arguendo, but not deciding, that retaliation claims can survive summary judgment under a convincing-mosaic theory"), with Calvert v. Doe, 648 Fed. Appx. 925, 929 (11th Cir. April 25, 2016) (finding that plaintiff "ha[s] established 'a convincing mosaic [*65]  of circumstantial evidence' that would permit a jury to infer that the county retaliated against him because of his previous lawsuit). But see Lewis v. Blue Bird Corp., 835 Fed. Appx. 526, 2020 WL 6882056, at *2 (11th Cir. 2020) (holding, without further discussion, that under the convincing mosaic standard, plaintiff had not proven that any of defendant's actions constituted racial discrimination or retaliation); Williams, 834 Fed. Appx. 482, 2020 WL 6335946, at *8 (same). The Court, however, assumes that an ADA plaintiff can survive summary judgment if the record, viewed in the light most favorable to her, "demonstrate[s] a 'convincing mosaic' of circumstantial evidence that warrants an inference" of retaliation. Lewis, 918 F.3d at 1220 n.6; see also Calvert, 648 Fed. Appx. at 929. Similar to analyzing an ADA discrimination claim, an ADA convincing-mosaic retaliation claim can be established by "(1) suspicious timing, ambiguous statements, similar behavior directed at other members of the protected group, and other bits and pieces from which an inference of discriminatory intent might be drawn; (2) systematically better treatment of those outside the protected class; and (3) pretext in the employer's justification." Robertson v. Riverstone Communities, LLC, No. 1:17-CV-02668-CAP, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121359, 2019 WL 3282991, at *6 (N.D. Ga. July 22, 2019) (quotation marks omitted).
The ADA extends protection to all activity and expression protected by the ADA, including making a request for a reasonable accommodation [*66]  under the statute. Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016) (citing Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs. Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998)). A plaintiff alleging ADA retaliation does not have to prove an underlying entitlement to the Act's protection. See Weeks v. Harden Mfg. Corp., 291 F.3d 1307, 1311-1312 (11th Cir. 2002). Instead, a plaintiff can establish that she engaged in statutorily protected conduct if she had a good faith, reasonable belief that the employer engaged in unlawful employment practices. Little v. United Technologies, 103 F.3d 956, 960 (11th Cir. 1997). To prevail on ADA retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show but-for causation between statutorily protected expression and adverse employment action. Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258.
The Court concludes that Plaintiff has shown the existence of genuine issue of material fact that she engaged in a statutorily-protected activity when she sought one-week leave on October 15, that is, she "ha[d] a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that h[er] activity [wa]s protected by the statute." Standard, 161 F.3d at 1328. While ultimately the leave request was not a reasonable accommodation because of Plaintiff's excessive absenteeism, nonetheless there is sufficient evidence to support an inference that she had a good-faith belief that she was entitled to a reasonable accommodation of her work schedule, given its relatively short duration and the fact that Defendant had not previously denied her leave in the past. [*67]  Nelson v. Chattahoochee Valley Hosp. Soc., 731 F. Supp. 2d 1217, 1234 (M.D. Ala. 2010) (holding that plaintiff engaged in protected activity when seeking leave for pregnancy, noting that she was not a lawyer and thus cannot be expected to know what the law requires or does not require; and she knew when she made her request for a reasonable accommodation that her supervisor had accommodated her first pregnancy and the pregnancies of several other employees).
Second, Plaintiff satisfies the adverse-action prong of an ADA retaliation claim since she has demonstrated at least a trial issue as to whether she was terminated.28 Third, given the short time period between her request and her apparent termination, she has demonstrated a causal relation between her protected activity and her termination. Donnellon v. Fruehauf Corp., 794 F.2d 598, 601 (11th Cir. 1986) (holding one-month period between the protected activity and the adverse action sufficient to establish causation).
The burden thus shifts to Defendant to demonstrate a legitimate non-retaliatory reason for its action. As previously addressed, Defendant proffered as its non-retaliatory reason Plaintiff's excessive absenteeism. Excessive absenteeism is a legitimate and nondiscriminatory explanation for termination. See Cunningham v. Nature's Earth Pellets, LLC, 433 Fed. Appx. 751, 752 (11th Cir. July 6, 2011); Woodruff, 304 Fed. Appx. at 798; Wills v. Postmaster General, 300 Fed. Appx. 748, 752 (11th Cir. Nov. 21 2008).
Having detailed Plaintiff's pretext and convincing-mosaic [*68]  arguments in discussing Plaintiff's discrimination claim, the Court does not address them again at length here. Plaintiff offers the same arguments for both. Indeed, the section on pretext in the retaliation portion of her brief includes only a reference back to the earlier pretext argument in the discrimination portion of her brief. [Compare Doc. 68 at 40, with id. at 23-31]. In short, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact either as to pretext or a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence and, as such, Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim must also fail. Lewis, 918 F.3d at 1220. As discussed above, Plaintiff has not shown better treatment of an individual outside her protected class. And although for her retaliation claim she does not have to prove her underlying ADA discrimination claim, she must meet Defendant's legitimate non-discriminatory reason—excessive absenteeism—head on, which she has failed to do. Gilliard, 500 Fed. Appx. at 864-65. Although the convincing-mosaic theory may be supported by suspicious timing of the adverse action, there is nothing suspicious about the timing of Defendant's adverse action here. In other words, whether Plaintiff was terminated or Williams' made [*69]  a request for her to resign-or-be-fired, both would have come after Plaintiff requested further leave on top of being absent for approximately one-half of her tenure in Defendant's employ and with very little time after she returned to work immediately before requesting additional leave). Thus, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant's action was either out of context or "out of the blue."
Therefore, Plaintiff has not shown that her termination or Defendant's request that she resign was pretext for anti-disability retaliation, nor has she established a convincing-mosaic case for retaliation. Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim be GRANTED.

V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment, [Doc. 45], be GRANTED.
Because the matter presents no other issues referred to Magistrate Judges under Standing Order 18-01 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 12, 2018), the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference to the undersigned Magistrate Judge.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED and DIRECTED, this 3d day of February, 2021.
