Opinion



ORDER
Before the Court is Defendant Knox County, Tennessee's ("Knox County") motion to dismiss (Doc. 12). For the following reasons, the Court will DENY Knox County's motion.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff John Lott is a veteran of the United States Army and served for thirty years. (Doc. 11, at 2.) In 2013, a licensed clinical psychologist diagnosed Lott with an "anxiety disorder (subsyndromal post-traumatic stress disorder)." (Id. at 2-3.) A second clinical psychologist diagnosed Lott with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder ("PTSD") in 2019. (Id. at 3.) Lott alleges that his "psychiatric impairment" substantially limits his major life activities including concentration, thinking, [*2]  and brain function. (Id. at 3.)
From August 2002 to August 12, 2020, Knox County employed Lott. (Id.) In October 2014, Lott became the Senior Director for the Knox County Regional Forensic Center ("RFC"). (Id. at 3.) The RFC performs autopsies for residents of Knox County and Anderson County. (Id. at 4.) As the Director of RFC, Lott regularly witnessed bodies that had been murdered, burned, and otherwise traumatized. (Id.) Over time, the direct exposure to these bodies exacerbated Lott's disability and caused him severe mental trauma, which reached a particularly taxing height in 2018. (Id.)
At the time of the events underlying this action, Lott reported to Bryan Hair, Chief of Staff for Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs. (Id.) Lott made Hair aware of how the accumulated stress from his job was exacerbating his PTSD, which necessitated him taking "mental health days" off work. (Id. at 5.) Although Lott's performance evaluation in January 2019 rated him "Highly Effective" in his position, the continued exposure to death took a toll on his mental health. (Id.)
On August 5, 2019, Lott asked Hair for a reassignment or transfer to a position in which he would not confront the sort of traumas [*3]  he encountered as Senior Director of RFC. (Id.) On August 8, 2019, Human Resources Director Marcus Kennedy placed Lott on leave for an investigation resulting from a non-specific complaint lodged against Lott and two other individuals. (Id.)
A week later, on August 13, 2019, Lott was called into a meeting with Kennedy, Hair, and Richard Julian. (Id.) During this meeting, Lott was told that the investigation had cleared him of any wrongdoing. (Id.) Hair then told Lott that he had asked Kennedy and Julian to "speak to other Senior Directors about Lott's request for reassignment/transfer, but it was not possible because there were no positions available in the County." (Id. at 6.) Lott submitted his resignation on August 13, 2019, believing that no other positions were available for him. (Id.)
On December 23, 2020, Lott filed suit against Knox County, claiming a denial of reasonable accommodations and discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA".) (Id. at 7.) In his complaint, Lott alleges that his resignation was caused by the "refusal of Knox County to engage in the interactive process of transfer/reassignment in good faith," and that "it was possible to transfer Lott to an open and available position in [Knox County] [*4]  that did not involve repeat exposure to death, burns[,] and trauma, and for which Lott was qualified to perform." (Id. at 6 (emphasis in original)). Lott alleges that Knox County's failure to accommodate was knowing and intentional. (Id.) Knox County has moved to dismiss Lott's complaint for failure to state a claim (Doc. 12), and the motion is now ripe for review.

II. STANDARD OF LAW
Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires a plaintiff's complaint to contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Though the statement need not contain detailed factual allegations, it must contain "factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). Rule 8 "demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation." Id.
A defendant may obtain dismissal of a claim that fails to satisfy Rule 8 by filing a motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court considers not whether the plaintiff will ultimately prevail, but whether the facts permit the court to infer "more than the mere possibility of misconduct." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. For purposes of this determination, "all well-pleaded material allegations of the pleadings [*5]  of the opposing party must be taken as true, and the motion may be granted only if the moving party is nevertheless clearly entitled to judgment." Tucker v. Middleburg-Legacy Place, 539 F.3d 545, 549 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. Winget, 510 F.3d 577, 581 (6th Cir. 2007)). This assumption of veracity, however, does not extend to bare assertions of legal conclusions, Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679, nor is the Court "bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation." Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S. Ct. 2932, 92 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1986). A pleading that offers "labels and conclusions" or "a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).
After sorting the factual allegations from the legal conclusions, the Court next considers whether the factual allegations, if true, would support a claim entitling the plaintiff to relief. Thurman v. Pfizer, Inc., 484 F.3d 855, 859 (6th Cir. 2007). This factual matter must "state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). Plausibility "is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). "[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not 'show[n]'—'that the pleader is entitled to relief.'" Id. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).

III. ANALYSIS
The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating [*6]  against qualified employees because of a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). To state a claim for discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff "must plead facts that make plausible the inference that (1) [he] is disabled, (2) [he] is qualified to perform [his] job requirements with or without reasonable accommodation, and (3) [he] would not have been discharged but for the disability." Darby v. Childvine, Inc., 964 F.3d 440, 444 (6th Cir. 2020); Frengler v. Gen. Motors, 482 F. App'x 975, 976 (6th Cir. 2012). "A constructive discharge occurs when 'working conditions would have been so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee's shoes would have felt compelled to resign.'" Tchankpa v. Ascena Retail Grp., Inc., 951 F.3d 805, 814 (6th Cir. 2020) (citing Talley v. Family Dollar Stores of Ohio, Inc., 542 F.3d 1099, 1107 (6th Cir. 2008)).
Similarly, "[a] plaintiff asserting a claim of failure to accommodate under the ADA must show that [he] (1) has a disability, (2) was qualified for his job, and (3) requested a reasonable accommodation and was denied, or was subject to an adverse employment decision that was made solely because of [his] disability." Eachus v. Haslam, No. 3:15-cv-944, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9581, at *25-26 (M.D. Tenn. Jan. 27, 2016) (citing Dumas v. Hurley Med. Ctr., 837 F. Supp. 2d 655, 665-66 (E.D. Mich. 2011)).
Knox County moves to dismiss both of Lott's ADA claims against it, arguing that he failed to allege that: (1) he was qualified for any particular vacant position within Knox County or that he requested a transfer to such position; (2) he complied with Knox County's non-discriminatory policy requiring him [*7]  to apply for a transfer to a desired position; and (3) he had been diagnosed with PTSD by a competent licensed professional prior to his resignation or that Knox County was aware of such diagnosis. (Doc. 12, at 3-13.)
Knox County's first two arguments for dismissal are related. Knox County argues that (1) Lott has not alleged with sufficient specificity that an alternate employment position was available for which he was qualified, and (2) Lott failed to comply with Knox County's employee handbook governing employee transfers to such a position, which is a legitimate non-discriminatory policy that Lott must follow. Knox County asks the Court to find Lott's claims deficient in light of Burns v. Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc., 222 F.3d 247 (6th Cir. 2000). (Id. at 3-4.) However, in Burns, the Sixth Circuit affirmed a grant of summary judgment under the ADA, not dismissal. 222 F.3d 247 at 249. The pleading standard for a cause of action and the elements of its prima facie case are not necessarily identical. See, e.g., Keys v. Humana, Inc., 684 F.3d 605, 609-10 (6th Cir. 2012) (citing Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002)); Krueger v. Home Depot USA, Inc., 674 F. App'x 490, 493 (6th Cir. 2017)). "A claimant need not [] allege facts establishing a prima facie case of disability discrimination to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)." Morgan v. St. Francis Hosp., No. 19-5162, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 29887, at *3 (6th Cir. 2019) (citing Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 510-12). A plaintiff "need only 'give the defendant fair notice of what [his] claim is and the grounds upon [*8]  which it rests.'" Id. (citing Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 512). In light of the foregoing, it would be inappropriate for the Court to apply Burns's more stringent standard as to what is required to prevail on a claim for disability discrimination to determine whether Lott has sufficiently pled a claim for disability discrimination.

A. Whether Lott Is Disabled Under the ADA
The ADA defines "disability" as:
(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual;
(B) a record of such an impairment; or
(C) being regarded as having such an impairment[.]
42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). The ADA instructs courts to construe the definition of disability "in favor of broad coverage of individuals." Id. § 12102(4)(A). As relevant to the first definition of "disability," the ADA provides the following non-exhaustive list of "major life activities":
caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.
42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). Major life activities also include "the operation of a major bodily function," such as "functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, [*9]  neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions." Id. § 12102(2)(B).
Here, Lott has sufficiently alleged that he is disabled under the first ADA definition of disability. He alleges that he was diagnosed by a licensed clinical psychologist with an "anxiety disorder (subsyndromal post-traumatic stress disorder)" in 2013, and that he was again diagnosed by a second clinical psychologist with chronic PTSD in 2019. (Doc. 11, at 3.) Taking the well-pled allegations of the amended complaint as true, Lott received an anxiety diagnosis in 2013 while exhibiting symptoms of PTSD, and a PTSD diagnosis came sometime in 2019. Lott has also alleged that his "psychiatric impairment" substantially limits him in major life activities including concentration, thinking, and neurological function, constituting a disability under the ADA. (Id. at 2.) Knox County's arguments concerning this element fail because the ADA does not require a formal diagnosis or an employer's awareness of the disability, so long as the employee has alleged that he had "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual." See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).
Even so, Lott further [*10]  alleges that he told his supervisor, Bryan Hair, that his position was "exacerbating his PTSD" prior to requesting an accommodation via reassignment or transfer in August 2019. (Id. at 4-5.) Under the facts of the complaint, the Court finds that Lott has plausibly pled that he has a disability under the ADA and that Knox County was aware of that disability prior to him requesting an accommodation, because he has given Knox County "fair notice of what [his] claim is and the grounds upon which it rests" with respect to his disability. Morgan, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 29887 at *3. Knox County will have the opportunity to investigate the exact dates of Lott's diagnoses through discovery. The motion to dismiss standard, however, is not so exacting as to require that the whole of Plaintiff's complaint fail simply because the exact date of Lott's 2019 diagnosis is not included.

B. Whether Lott Was Qualified for His Position or Another Position
Under the ADA, an employee is a "qualified individual" if he can perform the essential functions of his job with or without a reasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Lott alleges that he served in his Senior Director position at the RFC from 2014 to his resignation in 2019 and that he was "highly effective" [*11]  in his position, despite his disability, until an increase in mental strain motivated him to ask for reassignment or transfer to a new position as an accommodation. (Id. at 3, 5.) After Lott requested an accommodation for his disability, namely a transfer, he was told by his supervisor that there were no positions available in Knox County for him.1 (Id. at 6.) Lott alleges that he resigned involuntarily in order to escape the mental harm from his job, based on Knox County's refusal to "engage in the interactive process of transfer/reassignment in good faith." (Id.)
Taking these allegations as true, the Court finds these facts sufficient to allege that Lott was a qualified individual and that he was denied a requested accommodation and constructively discharged from his position. See Tchankpa, 951 F.3d at 814 (6th Cir. 2020). Whatever additional facts may be required to prove he is entitled to relief under the ADA, such as specific alternate employment positions that were available and whether he was qualified for them, Lott has satisfied the standard to plead disability discrimination and failure to accommodate against Knox County because he has given Knox County "fair notice of what [his] claim is and the grounds upon which [*12]  it rests." Morgan, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 29887 at *3.

C. Procedures Outlined in the Employment Handbook
With respect to whether Lott complied with specific provisions of Knox County's employment handbook governing employee transfers to new positions, the handbook was not attached to the complaint. Rule 12(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that "if, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56." Courts can, however, consider certain documents attached to a motion to dismiss without converting the motion to one for summary judgment if the documents are public records. See Rondigo, L.L.C. v. Twp. of Richmond, 641 F.3d 673, 680 (6th Cir. 2011) (providing that courts may consider "exhibits attached [to pleadings], public records, items appearing in the record of the case and exhibits attached to defendant's motion to dismiss so long as they are referred to in the complaint and are central to the claims contained therein, without converting the motion to one for summary judgment").
The Court declines to take judicial notice of the 2017 employment handbook attached to Knox County's motion to dismiss (Doc. 12-1). The Court has been unable to locate the 2017 version of the handbook that Knox County seeks to rely on through [*13]  the County's website or any other publicly available site. Although Lott does discuss contents of the employee handbook in his response to Knox County's motion, he does not concede that the handbook is a public record and makes arguments relating to the language of the handbook arguendo. (See Doc. 15, at 9.) Even if the Court were to consider the 2017 employment handbook, it is inappropriate at this juncture to make factual determinations related to which provisions of the handbook Lott was required to follow, whether he failed to do so, and how such failures affect his ability to recover under the ADA. Further, Lott has specifically alleged that Knox County told him there were no open positions for him, which led to his resignation. The Court declines to dismiss Lott's complaint on the basis that he did not search out or apply for a new position per the rules of Knox County's employment handbook when he'd been told no such position existed. On a motion to dismiss, the Court must take all facts alleged in the complaint as true and determine whether those facts, in light of the applicable pleading standards, state a claim for relief. As previously explained, Lott has adequately pled [*14]  his claims under the ADA.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Knox County's motion to dismiss (Doc. 12) is DENIED.
SO ORDERED.
