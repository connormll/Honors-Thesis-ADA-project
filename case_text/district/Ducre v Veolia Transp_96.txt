Opinion


ORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO STRIKE PLAINTIFF'S SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S PUNITIVE DAMAGES CLAIM
Willie Marie Ducre filed this action in Los Angeles Superior Court on November 5, 2009, against her former employer, Veolia Transportation Services, Inc. and several of the company's employees.1 The state court dismissed the individual defendants on March 11, 2010; Veolia then removed the case on March 31, 2010, invoking the court's diversity jurisdiction.2 On April 2, 2010, plaintiff filed a first amended complaint.3 Plaintiff alleges that she was wrongfully terminated from her employment as a bus driver for [*2]  Veolia due to a physical disability. She pleads five claims: (1) disability discrimination in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), California Government Code § 12940 et seq.; (2) failure to engage in the interactive process in violation of FEHA; (3) failure to accommodate her disability in violation of FEHA; (4) failure to maintain an environment free from discrimination in violation of FEHA; and (5) wrongful termination in violation of public policy.4 In her prayer for relief, plaintiff seeks punitive damages on each claim pursuant to California Civil Code § 3294.5 On April 22, 2010, Veolia has moved to strike portions of plaintiff's first amended complaint under Rule 12(f).6 On June 14, 2010, the court dismissed plaintiff's punitive damages claim without prejudice, and granted plaintiff leave to amend within thirty days of the date of the order.7
On July 20, 2010, the court granted plaintiff additional time to file a second amended complaint, and directed that the complaint be filed no later than August 13, 2010.8 On August 13, 2010, plaintiff filed her second amended complaint electronically.9 The court struck the pleading for failure to comply with General Order 10-07, which provides that all initiating documents must be [*3]  manually filed at the Clerk's Office window.10 Plaintiff attempted manually to file her second amended complaint, which pleads the same claims and seeks the same relief as her first amended complaint, on August 16, 2010.11 On August 17, 2010, the court ordered that the pleading be deemed filed on August 16, 2010, the date it was "received but not filed."12 On August 27, 2010, Veolia moved to strike plaintiff's second amended complaint as untimely under Rule 12(f); alternatively, Veolia moved to dismiss plaintiff's punitive damages claim under Rule 12(b)(6).13 Plaintiff opposes Veolia's motion.14
Velonia's motion is currently on calendar for hearing on November 15, 2010. Pursuant to Rule 78 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 7-15, the court finds the matter appropriate for decision without oral argument and vacates the hearing scheduled for November 15, 2010.

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Ducre began working for Veolia in 1992 and was principally employed as a bus driver for the next fifteen years.15 In 2005, Ducre was injured in a work-related incident and was unable to work until June 2007.16 In December 2006, after Ducre filed a worker's compensation case, the parties' agreed-upon medical examiner examined her and prepared a report stating that Ducre could "perform the [*4]  duties of her usual and customary occupation."17 Ducre alleges, on information and belief, that Veolia received the medical examiner's report in March 2007.18 Three months later, in June 2007, Ducre informed Veolia's safety manager, Kevin Wilder, that she wished to return to work as a bus driver. Veolia purportedly refused to allow her to do so.19
Thereafter, Ducre asked Wilder whether Veolia would permit her to return to work if she wore a leg brace, and provided medical documentation from her treating physician, which stated that she was able to work while wearing a brace.20 Wilder denied Ducre's request.21 Ducre told Veolia's general manager, Harrold Hollis, and the human resources department that she had asked to return to work wearing a leg brace. She gave Hollis and the human resources department medical documentation, and advised them of Wilder's denial of the request.22 Purportedly, neither Hollis nor Veolia's human resources personnel granted the request, or engaged in an interactive process with Ducre.23 Ducre alleges that in or about July 2007, she repeatedly asked Wilder, safety manager Charles Gatewood, manager Steve Rodriguez, and Veolia's human resources department to [*5]  allow her to return to her bus driving responsibilities.24 She asserts that Veolia "incorrectly stated that she could not return to work as a bus driver while wearing a leg brace," without consulting Ducre or her physician.25 She contends that Veolia "had no basis for its opinion that Plaintiff could not operate a bus while wearing the leg brace," and that it failed to investigate or engage in an interactive process to determine if she could perform the required job functions of a bus driver.26
Thereafter, Ducre was assigned to "light duty detail" performing clerical tasks.27 Ducre contends that due to her reassignment, she was unable to work overtime and suffered a significant loss of income.28 Ducre alleges that the decrease in income was devastating to her, as she is the sole caretaker for her mentally disabled adult son. She asserts that she began to suffer anxiety, and feared she would become unable to provide for her son.29
Ducre performed the "light duty detail" until November 13, 2007, when she was terminated.30 On that date, safety manager Jacob Ortiz told Ducre that she should go home, because there was no record that she worked for Veolia, even though Ducre [*6]  had been employed by the company for more than fifteen years.31 Prior to leaving work that day, Ducre called her union representative, Jackie Gray, who advised her to gather her medical paperwork and return to work.32 Ducre alleges, on information and belief, that Gray called Hollis that same day to inquire why there were no records of Ducre's employment, but Hollis did not look into the matter.33
On November 15, 2007, a day before receiving the termination letter, Ducre obtained a medical report stating both that she was able to drive while wearing a leg brace, and that the leg brace was not necessary while driving.34 Ducre promptly informed Rodriguez and Ortiz of the contents of the letter, but both advised her that she was nonetheless being terminated.35 On November 16, 2007, Ducre received a termination letter from Ortiz stating, in pertinent part, that "[i]t ha[d] recently come to [Veolia's] attention that on March 20, 2007, a report was generated by the Agreed Medical Examiner . . . [which] indicated that [Ducre was] declared to be 'Permanent and Stationary,' as of December 2006." The letter stated that the report had "place[d] permanent work restrictions on [Ducre] concerning [*7]  the cervical and lumbar areas of [her] body," and asserted that Veolia had "been advised, as it pertains to [Ducre's] work[er's] comp case, [that] no other medical paper work [was] to be considered valid." The letter concluded: "Due to the permanent work restriction placed upon you . . . we must inform you that Veolia has no permanent job that would accommodate your permanent work restrictions."36 The letter asserted that Ducre's last day of work had been November 12, 2007, when in fact her final day was her birthday, November 13. Ducre contends this discrepancy "is consistent with the callous, malicious and oppressive manner in which Veolia treated [her] throughout her tenure. . . ."37
Ducre asserts that Veolia offered "no lawful explanation as to why she could not continue with 'light detail duty' . . . [or] why she could not return to being a bus driver."38 She contends that, despite receiving a medical report stating that she could drive with a leg brace, and later receiving full medical clearance to return to work without restriction, Veolia refused to allow her to return to her job as a bus driver.39
She asserts that the "acts and conduct of the Defendants, and each of [*8]  them, constituted 'malice,' 'oppression' and/or 'fraud' (as those are terms are defined in California Civil Code § 3294(c)), in that [the acts were] intended by Defendants, and each of them, to cause injury to Plaintiff or [constituted] despicable conduct which was carried on by the Defendants, and each of them, with willful and conscious disregard of the rights of Plaintiff."40 Ducre also alleges that the "acts of Defendants, and each of them, were done fraudulently, maliciously and oppressively and with . . . advance knowledge, conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, within the meaning of Civil Code § 3294[,] on the part of Defendants' officers, directors, or managing agents of the corporation."41

II. DISCUSSION

A. Legal Standard Governing Motions to Strike Under Rule 12(f)
Rule 12(f) allows a court to "order stricken from any pleading . . . any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter." Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 12(f). "The essential function of a Rule 12(f) motion is to 'avoid the expenditure of time and money that must arise from litigating spurious issues by dispensing with those issues prior to trial." Bureerong v. Uvawas, 922 F.Supp. 1450, 1478 (C.D. Cal. 1996) (quoting Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty, 984 F.2d 1524, 1527 (9th Cir. 1993), overruled on other grounds, 510 U.S. 517, 114 S. Ct. 1023, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1994)). "'[M]otions to strike should not be granted[, however,] unless it is clear that the [*9]  matter to be stricken could have no possible bearing on the subject matter of the litigation.'" United States v. Wang, 404 F.Supp.2d 1155, 1157 (N.D. Cal. 2005) (citing Colaprico v. Sun Microsystems, Inc., 758 F.Supp. 1335, 1339 (N.D. Cal. 1991)). Indeed, such "motions are rarely granted . . . when the moving party can show no prejudice as a result" of the matter included in a pleading. Garcia-Barajas v. Nestle Purina Petcare Co., No. 1:09-CV-00025 OWW DLB, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63964, 2009 WL 2151850, *2 n. 2 (E.D. Cal. Jul. 16, 2009) (citing Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal.4th 1028, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005)).

B. Whether the Court Should Strike Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint
Veolia argues that plaintiff's complaint should be stricken as untimely.42 Ducre filed her amended pleading electronically on Friday, August 13, 2010, the deadline set by the court. Because pleadings initiating lawsuits or claims, including amended pleadings, must be filed manually, the court struck the electronically filed pleading for failure to comply with General Order 10-07, and directed plaintiff to file the pleading manually on the next business day, Monday, August 16, 2010. Plaintiff did so, but the clerk's office, apparently unaware of the court's order striking the August 13 filing and directing that the amended complaint be manually filed by August 16, refused to accept the pleading because it was untimely and a duplicate had already been e-filed.43 On August 17, 2010, the court ordered that the [*10]  pleading be filed as of August 16, 2010.44 This chronology demonstrates that plaintiff attempted to comply with the court's order regarding the filing of an amended complaint and that, but for the General Order requiring that amended complaints be manually filed, it would have been in full compliance with the order.45 Veolia does not contend that it has been prejudiced by the technically late filing. Indeed, Veolia received a copy of the second amended complaint electronically on August 13, 2010.46 See Garcia-Barajas, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63964, 2009 WL 2151850 at *2 n. 2. Given plaintiff's substantial compliance with the court's order and the fact that Veolia can show no prejudice resulting from the day delay in filing, the court denies its motion to strike the pleading as untimely.

C. Legal Standard Governing Motions To Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6)
A Rule 12(b)(6) motion tests the legal sufficiency of the claims asserted in the complaint. A Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal is proper only where there is either a "lack of a cognizable legal theory" or "the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory." Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep't, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988). The court must accept all factual allegations pleaded in the complaint as true, and construe them and draw all reasonable inferences from them in favor of the nonmoving party. Cahill v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 80 F.3d 336, 337-38 (9th Cir. 1996); Mier v. Owens, 57 F.3d 747, 750 (9th Cir. 1995) [*11] .
The court need not, however, accept as true unreasonable inferences or legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations. See Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 553-56, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) ("While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to relief' requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do"). Plaintiff's complaint must "contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' . . . A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009); see also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 545 ("Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)" (citations omitted)); Moss v. U.S. Secret Service, 572 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2009) ("[F]or a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss, the nonconclusory 'factual content,' and reasonable inferences from that content, must be plausibly suggestive of a claim entitling the plaintiff to relief," [*12]  citing Iqbal and Twombly).

D. Standards for Pleading a State Law Punitive Damages Claim Under Rules 8 and 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
Although federal courts sitting in diversity apply the substantive law of the forum state, federal procedural rules govern. See Clark v. Allstate Insurance Co., 106 F.Supp.2d 1016, 1018 (S.D. Cal. 2000) ("It is well-established that federal courts sitting in diversity must apply state substantive law and federal procedural rules," citing Computer Economics, Inc. v. Gartner Group, Inc., 50 F.Supp.2d 980, 986 (S.D. Cal. 1999), and Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. Ed. 1188 (1938)). "Where state law directly conflicts with applicable provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, federal courts must apply the Federal Rules - not state law." Id. (citing Computer Economics, 50 F.Supp.2d at 986 and Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 471, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8 (1965)).
Ducre seeks punitive damages under California Civil Code § 3294, asserting that Veolia's actions "constituted 'malice,' 'oppression' and/or 'fraud'" under the statute.47 Section 3294 provides:
"In an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff, in addition to the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a).48
To support a punitive damages claim against an employer based on the acts of its employees, a plaintiff must establish that "the employer had advance knowledge of the [*13]  unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded. . . ." Id., § 3294(b). Further, where defendant is a "corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation." Id.
The California Supreme Court has held that "supervisors who have broad discretionary powers and exercise substantial discretionary authority in the corporation [can] be managing agents." White v. Ultramar, 21 Cal.4th 563, 577, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944 (1999) ("Conversely, supervisors who have no discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy would not be considered managing agents even though they may have the ability to hire or fire other employees. In order to demonstrate that an employee is a true managing agent under section 3294, subdivision (b), a plaintiff seeking punitive damages would have to show that the employee exercised substantial discretionary authority over significant aspects of a corporation's business").
While California courts have imposed a heightened pleading standard [*14]  for punitive damages claims, federal procedural law has not. See Robinson v. Managed Accounts Receivables Corp., 654 F.Supp.2d 1051, 1066 (C.D. Cal. 2009) ("[T]he fact that California courts may impose a heightened pleading requirement on claims for punitive damages is irrelevant, because such a requirement conflicts with federal procedural law," citing Clark, 231 F.R.D. at 406 ("While California law governs Plaintiff's substantive claim for punitive damages . . . , the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern the punitive damages claim procedurally with respect to the adequacy of pleadings")); see also Jackson v. East Bay Hosp., 980 F.Supp. 1341, 1353 (N.D. Cal. 1997) ("Although the court will apply the substantive law embodied in section 3294, 'determinations regarding the adequacy of pleadings are governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,'" quoting Pease & Curren Refining, Inc. v. Spectrolab, Inc., 744 F.Supp. 945, 948 (C.D. Cal. 1990), abrogated on other grounds, Stanton Road Associates v. Lohrey Enterprises, 984 F.2d 1015 (9th Cir. 1993)).
Rule 8(a) requires that a plaintiff provide "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that [Plaintiff] is entitled to relief, and . . . a demand for judgment for the relief [he] seeks." Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 8(a). Rule 9(b) states that "[m]alice, intent, knowledge and other conditions of a person's mind may be averred generally." Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 9(b). A long line of federal decisions has interpreted these rules as setting a low threshold for the pleading of punitive claims claims alleging malice under Civil Code § 3294. See Bureerong, 922 F.Supp. at 1480 ("although [Civil] Code [*15]  § 3294 . . . require[s] 'oppression, fraud, or malice' for punitive damages, these allegations 'may be averred generally,'" quoting Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 9(b)); Jackson, 980 F.Supp. at 1353-54 ("Although the court will apply the substantive law embodied in section 3294, 'determinations regarding the adequacy of pleadings are governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.' . . . Therefore, despite section 3294's specific requirement that a pleading allege oppression, fraud or malice, these 'may be averred generally'"); Pease & Curren Refining, Inc., 744 F.Supp. at 949 (holding that pleading malice generally was sufficient to support a punitive damages prayer, and that defendant's challenge to the prayer was more "appropriately brought as a motion for summary judgment or a motion for summary adjudication of issues after discovery").
Following the Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868, however, the court must assess whether plaintiff's allegations of malice and oppression satisfy Rules 8(a) and 9(b). The Iqbal Court stated:
"It is true that Rule 9(b) requires particularity when pleading 'fraud or mistake,' while allowing '[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind [to] be alleged generally.' But 'generally' is a relative term. In the context of Rule 9, it is to be compared to the particularity requirement applicable to fraud or [*16]  mistake. Rule 9 merely excuses a party from pleading discriminatory intent under an elevated pleading standard. It does not give him license to evade the less rigid - though still operative - strictures of Rule 8. See 5A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §1301, p. 291 (3d ed. 2004) ('[A] rigid rule requiring the detailed pleading of a condition of mind would be undesirable because, absent overriding considerations pressing for a specificity requirement, as in the case of averments of fraud or mistake, the general 'short and plain statement of the claim' mandate in Rule 8(a) . . . should control the second sentence of Rule 9(b)'). And Rule 8 does not empower respondent to plead the bare elements of his cause of action, affix the label 'general allegation,' and expect his complaint to survive a motion to dismiss." Id. at 1954.
Under Iqbal, therefore, "general" allegations of malice under Rule 9(b) must satisfy the "short and plain statement" requirement of Rule 8(a). Examining this standard, the Iqbal Court held that a court need not accept as true unreasonable inferences or legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations. Id. at 1949 ("[B]are assertions . . . amount[ing] to nothing more than a 'formulaic recitation of the elements' of [*17]  a constitutional discrimination claim" are not entitled to an assumption of truth, quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555); see also Moss, 572 F.3d at 969 ("Such allegations are not to be discounted because they are 'unrealistic or nonsensical,' but rather because they do nothing more than state a legal conclusion - even if that conclusion is cast in the form of a factual allegation").
To satisfy Rule 8(a), a complaint must "contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' . . . A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 545 ("While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to relief' requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do. Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)" (citations omitted)).

E. Whether Ducre [*18]  Has Alleged Sufficient Facts to Support Her Punitive Damages Claim Against Veolia
Veolia is a corporate defendant, whose potential liability for punitive damages under § 3294 rests on the actions of its employees. Veolia argues that Ducre has failed to allege both (1) acts by its employees that constitute oppression, fraud, or malice;49 and (2) that any such acts were committed with "the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification . . . of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation,"50 as required for the imposition of corporate liability under § 3294(b).

1. Acts Constituting Oppression, Fraud, or Malice
Ducre's punitive damages claim refers to and tracks the language of § 3294, stating that the "acts and conduct of the Defendants, and each of them, constituted 'malice,' 'oppression' and/or 'fraud' (as those are terms are defined in California Civil Code § 3294(c))."51 Standing alone, this allegation is not sufficient to plead malice, oppression, or fraud because it is nothing more than a recitation of the legal standard governing punitive damages awards. See Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 ("[B]are assertions . . . amount[ing] to nothing more than a 'formulaic recitation of the elements' of a . . . claim" are not entitled to an [*19]  assumption of truth, quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555); Clemens v. Protection One, Inc., No. 09cv1424 L(CAB), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35636, 2010 WL 1445173, *3 (S.D. Cal. Apr. 12, 2010) ("Although the CFRA makes punitive damages available to plaintiff, he has made no allegation other than to state: 'Defendants' conduct was willful, reckless, oppressive, fraudulent and malicious.' Such a bald assertion does not meet the pleading standard under Twombly and Iqbal" (internal citations omitted)).
Ducre's complaint contains additional allegations, however, that plead facts providing a plausible basis for the recovery of punitive damages. Section 3294 defines "malice" as "conduct . . . intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct . . . carried on . . . with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others." It defines "oppression" as "despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person's rights." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(c). Ducre alleges that her supervisors at Veolia knew she had a disability that required her to wear a leg brace, and unjustly discriminated against her because of this disability by reassigning her to "light duty" work. She asserts they did so although she provided medical documentation indicating she could [*20]  return to her normal duties, which they refused to review, and also that on the last day she reported to work, safety manager Jacob Ortiz told her she should go home, because there was no record that she had ever worked for Veolia, despite the fact that she had been employed by the company for more than fifteen years. Finally, she alleges that Veolia eventually terminated her.52 Ducre contends she lost income and suffered hardship as a result of Veolia's actions.53 These factual allegations, which plead more than that Veolia failed to accommodate Ducre's disability and/or failed to engage in the interactive process, adequately allege malice and oppression under Rule 8(a) and Iqbal. See Reese v. Barton Healthcare Systems, 606 F.Supp.2d 1254, 1259, 1266 (E.D. Cal. 2008) (finding sufficient, in an opinion issued after Twombly, allegations "that beginning in January 2008, defendant tried to force plaintiff to quit and began harassing her and making it difficult to maintain her income level. Defendant reduced plaintiff's hours and rescheduled her to work on weekends when it knew that plaintiff taught dance on the weekends. Other non-disabled employees were available to work on weekends. Plaintiff alleges that defendant intentionally took these actions in an effort to force her to [*21]  quit because it did not want to accommodate her injury. . . . Plaintiff also alleges that the alleged wrongful acts were committed maliciously, fraudulently, oppressively, and in bad faith. . . . Accordingly defendant's motion to strike plaintiff's claim for punitive damages is denied"); see also Vermillion v. Corrections Corp. of America, No. CV F 08-1069 LJO SMS, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115067, 2008 WL 4755329, *10 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 29, 2008) (finding sufficient, in an opinion issued after Twombly, a punitive damages claim "[t]he gist of [which] is that the Warden terminated Mr. Vermillion based on disability and belatedly falsified the excessive force incident as a pretext for termination. Such alleged conduct demonstrates intent to injure Mr. Vermillion in willful and conscious disregard of his workers' compensation and FEHA rights. On its face, the FAC satisfies the elements for punitive damages"); compare Kelley v. Corrections Corp. of America, 750 F. Supp.2d 1132, 2010 WL 3853182, *13 (E.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2010) ("Plaintiff invites the court to read into facts that describe nothing more than the basic elements of failure to accommodate and failure to engage in the interactive process an evil motive based on nothing more than Plaintiff's bare characterization of Defendant's motives as evil. The court must decline the invitation. The court finds that Plaintiff's claims for punitive [*22]  damages are unsupported by allegation of any facts. The claims for punitive damages will therefore be dismissed"). See McGee v. Tucoemas Fed. Credit Union, 153 Cal.App.4th 1351, 1362, 63 Cal. Rptr. 3d 808 (2007) ("[I]t cannot be concluded that the punitive damages were excessive as a matter of law. Appellants' conduct was reprehensible. Following McGee's cancer surgery, appellants engaged in a pattern of behavior aimed at humiliating McGee and forcing her to quit. Appellants refused to provide McGee with medical accommodation, threatened to fire her if she did not return after four months and, when McGee did timely return, appellants demoted her, cut her pay in half and cancelled her medical coverage").

2. Corporate Liability Under § 3294(b)
To support a claim for punitive damages against an employer based on the acts of its employees, a plaintiff must also plead that "the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded. . . ." Id., § 3294(b). If the employer is a corporation, "the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part [*23]  of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation." Id. Not all supervisors are managing agents, and the scope of an employee's discretion and authority is a question of fact. See White, 21 Cal.4th at 567, 577 ("[S]upervisors who have no discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy would not be considered managing agents even though they may have the ability to hire or fire other employees. In order to demonstrate that an employee is a true managing agent under section 3294, subdivision (b), a plaintiff seeking punitive damages must show that the employee exercised substantial discretionary authority over significant aspects of a corporation's business").
Ducre alleges that the "acts of Defendants, and each of them, were done fraudulently, maliciously and oppressively and with the advance knowledge, conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, within the meaning of Civil Code § 3294 on the part of Defendants' officers, directors, or managing agents of the corporation."54 In isolation, this allegation is nothing more than a "'formulaic recitation of the elements'" required to recover punitive damages from a corporate employer under § 3294, and is "not entitled to an assumption of [*24]  truth." Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).
Ducre pleads additional facts in support of her claim, however. Specifically, she alleges that, "[a]s safety manager, Kevin Wilder was authorized by Veolia to oversee Plaintiff's day to day activities, implement policies and procedures relating to the operations and business practices of Veolia, implement disciplinary actions when required, and generally regulate conduct among employees. Based upon Wilder's scope of duties and permission to exercise discretion with respect to Plaintiff's job duties, Plaintiff's work restrictions as a result of her disability, and addressing Plaintiff's requests for accommodation, Wilder was a designated supervisor and decision maker."55 Ducre also asserts that "Hollis, Rodriguez, Wilder, Gatewood, and Ortiz were officers and/or directors and/or managing agents and employees of Veolia with the authority to speak for Veolia, and the ability to exercise substantial discretionary authority over the decisions that ultimately determine Veolia's corporate policy, in general[,] and each [was] involved in, participated in, authorized or ratified the unlawful events that are alleged herein, including but not limited to failing to permit [*25]  Plaintiff to return to driving the bus with a leg brace on, failing to engage in the interactive process, failing to provide Plaintiff the reasonable accommodation of wearing a leg brace while driving a bus, terminating Plaintiff's employment because she requested a reasonable accommodation, and failing to address Plaintiff's requests that Defendants review her medical documentation that stated she could drive the bus safely."56 Finally, Ducre alleges that "[a]s managers, Wilder, Ortiz, Rodriguez, Hollis, and Gatewood were authorized by Veolia to oversee Plaintiff's day to day activities, implement policies and procedures relating to the operations and business practices of Veolia, implement disciplinary actions when required, and generally regulate conduct among employees. Based upon the scope of duties and permission to exercise discretion with respect to Plaintiff's job duties, Plaintiff's work restrictions as a result of her disability, and addressing Plaintiff's requests for accommodation, Wilder, Ortiz, Rodriguez, Hollis, and Gatewood were designated supervisors and decision makers."57
These allegations support a plausible inference that the supervisors who reviewed - or [*26]  determined not to review - Ducre's medical documentation, and decided to reassign and ultimately terminate her, had discretion to determine how to apply corporate policies regarding disability accommodations for their subordinates. Indeed, taking Ducre's allegations as true, they appear to have done so in this case. The allegations are thus sufficient under Rule 8 to raise an inference that the employees Ducre names are "managing agents." See Almanza v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., No. 06-0553-WBS-GGH, 2007 U.S .Dist. LEXIS 60026, 2007 WL 2274927, *5 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 7, 2007) ("A manager's ability to decide whether or not a particular policy is applied in particular circumstances is tantamount to making decisions that affect both the store and company policy,") citing White, 21 Cal.4th at 577); Egan v. Mutual of Omaha, Ins. Co., 24 Cal.3d 809, 823 (1979) ("When employees dispose of insureds' claims with little, if any, supervision, they possess sufficient discretion for the law to impute their actions concerning those claims to the corporation"); cf. O'Quinn v. Raley's, No. 2:02-CV-00308-MCE-KJM, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19067, 2008 WL 686894, *2 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 12, 2008) ("Plaintiff worked for Defendant for several decades. . . . Plaintiff was not promoted despite evidence of his qualifications (including passing the manager's exam) . . . [and] only white employees were promoted to the positions Plaintiff sought. . . .based on the evidence [*27]  of Defendant's conduct over the several decades of Plaintiff's employment, a jury could reasonably infer and conclude that Defendant's treatment of Plaintiff was authorized or ratified by one or more of Defendant's officers and directors").
Moreover, even if Ducre had not alleged sufficient facts to support a finding that the named defendants are managing agents, she has pled sufficient facts tending to show that some managing agent at Veolia ratified the named defendants' decisions regarding her employment. See Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 621, 262 Cal. Rptr. 842 (1989) ("Ratification . . . may be established by any circumstantial or direct evidence demonstrating adoption or approval of the employee's actions by the corporate agent. Such ratification may be inferred from the fact that the employer, after being informed of the employee's actions, does not fully investigate and fails to repudiate the employee's conduct by redressing the harm done and punishing or discharging the employee" (citations omitted)); cf. Roby v. McKesson Corp., 47 Cal.4th 686, 715, 101 Cal. Rptr. 3d 773, 219 P.3d 749 (2009) ("Roby's statement at th[e] meeting, [alleging harassment,] combined with the more general complaints that Roby made, constituted sufficient evidence to support the jury's inference that a McKesson managing agent eventually became [*28]  aware of [a supervisor's] unlawful harassment of Roby. That McKesson thereafter continued to employ [the supervisor] . . . without taking any corrective measures indicates 'conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others,' thus warranting punitive damages," citing § 3294(b)). Accordingly, Ducre has sufficiently pled facts that would support the awarding of punitive damages against Veolia under § 3294(b).

III. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated, the court denies Veolia's motion to strike plaintiff's complaint or, in the alternative, to dismiss plaintiff's punitive damages claims.
