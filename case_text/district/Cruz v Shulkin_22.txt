Opinion



ORDER
Pending before the Court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 60). Plaintiff filed three stipulations to extend her time to respond to Defendant's motion (Docs. 65, 71, 73.) The Court granted all the extensions. (Docs. 66, 72, 74.) The final extension granted Plaintiff until September 21, 2018, to respond. (Doc. 74.) The Plaintiff failed to file any response, or any request an extension. The Court then ordered Plaintiff to respond by March 1, 2019, and notified Plaintiff that if she did not respond the Court would rule without her input. (Doc. 75.) Plaintiff again failed to respond. The Court considers this matter ripe for its consideration.

FACTS
Based on the Amended Complaint (Doc. 20) and the Statement of Facts (Doc. 61), the Court understands the undisputed facts to be as follows:
Plaintiff was employed by the Southern Arizona Veterans Administration Health Center [*2]  ("SAVAHCS") as a medical supply technician. In 2009, Plaintiff was diagnosed with situational depression with anxiety disorder. In 2010, Plaintiff and Sylvia Nunez, Plaintiff's second-line supervisor, participated in mediation to resolve what Plaintiff described as harassing behaviors. After mediation, Plaintiff's and Ms. Nunez' relationship did not improve. The harassing behaviors only continued or increased. Plaintiff also filed an EEOC complaint in 2013. The details of the complaint were not included in the record.
Plaintiff began taking intermittent Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") leave in 2013. Plaintiff did not assert that FMLA leave was ever disapproved or denied.
On April 8, 2014, Natalie Miller, Plaintiff's first-line supervisor, issued a proposed admonishment to Plaintiff. The proposed admonishment alleged that Plaintiff was disrespectful toward a VA supervisor. First, it alleged that on December 18, 2013, an employee discovered damp wrappers on a sterilized tray from a previous shift. This indicated contamination or a failure in the sterilization procedure. Then Plaintiff entered the room with Ms. Nunez and reportedly yelled that the issue was not being handled properly [*3]  and that she was going to call infection control. Ms. Nunez noticed that Plaintiff was wearing scrubs that were no longer purchased at their location and told Plaintiff that she needed to wear facility-laundered scrubs. Plaintiff responded that she was wearing facility-laundered scrubs. After some argument between Ms. Nunez and Plaintiff, Plaintiff told Ms. Nunez not to talk to her and left the room. Multiple employees had been reminded to wear facility-laundered scrubs, including through a memorandum and training.
Second, the proposed admonishment alleged that on December 16, 2013, Plaintiff and another employee requested Christmas and New Year's off. Ms. Nunez denied the request and reminded the two that the section had voted to split Christmas and New Year's leave to allow more employees to take leave during the holiday season. Plaintiff allegedly began to yell1 at Ms. Nunez.
On June 16, 2014, the proposed admonishment was rescinded, and the following day, a clarification of expectations and direct order to wear facility-supplied and -laundered scrubs was issued.
During this time Margaret Plummer, the human resources ("HR") specialist at SAVAHCS, notified Plaintiff that Plaintiff should [*4]  contact Florence Gores regarding a potential position in a different care line with different supervisors. Ms. Gores interviewed Plaintiff and decided that she wanted to transfer Plaintiff to her supervision. However, Ms. Gores was informed by HR that she would need to write a job description and classify the new position to initiate the type of transfer Ms. Gores desired. Ms. Gores told HR that she did not have the ability or time to complete that request. Diane Smith, the chief of the Nurse Executive's Office, decided that such a transfer could not be justified because Plaintiff's unit was already short staffed.2 On April 29, 2014, Plaintiff learned that any offer from Ms. Gores was retracted because of the logistical barriers previously outlined. Ms. Gores did not consult with Ms. Nunez or Ms. Miller in this decision. No other individual received the potential position with Ms. Gores.
On July 21, 2014, Ms. Nunez issued a proposed seven-day suspension to Plaintiff. The proposed suspension stated that Plaintiff misused her FMLA leave. Specifically, it alleged that on May 21, 2014, Ms. Nunez again claimed that Plaintiff was not wearing facility-laundered scrubs. Ms. Nunez stated that [*5]  Plaintiff claimed that the scrubs were laundered by the hospital, but when working in "clean" areas the scrubs can be worn multiple times between laundering. Ms. Miller discovered that the door between the decontamination area and a clean equipment storage area had been taped, thereby allowing entry between to two areas. This created a potential contamination issue. Ms. Miller informed Ms. Nunez in a room where Plaintiff was working. Plaintiff perceived this as an accusation and informed them that she did not tape the doors and that they should install cameras to catch the culprit. Ms. Miller stated that she was not talking specifically about or to Plaintiff. Plaintiff then left to check her email. Ms. Miller accused Plaintiff of being rude and walking out on her. Plaintiff responded that Ms. Miller was not talking to her. Then Ms. Miller noticed a biological indicator that was left by the previous shift. Ms. Miller requested that Plaintiff take the biological indicator to the lab before checking her email. Plaintiff responded that she was taking FMLA leave. Plaintiff remained at the computer and Ms. Miller stated that if Plaintiff was going to use FMLA that she needed to leave. Plaintiff [*6]  explained that she was sending an email to her Union Representative after clocking out.
Second, the proposed suspension alleged that from June 16, 2014, to June 24, 2014, Plaintiff was on FMLA leave. However, she came into the facility on June 23, 2014, and June 24, 2014, to participate in job interviews.3 Management previously informed Plaintiff of the FMLA policy.
The proposed suspension also charged Plaintiff with failing to comply with the proper leave procedures, which resulted in an absence without leave. Specifically, it alleged that on March 20, 2014, Plaintiff told Ms. Nunez that Plaintiff had a family emergency and that she had to leave. The next day, Plaintiff called in and stated that she was out CB. Plaintiff was attending to a legal problem, which does not fall under CB, which covers leave to attend to a family health emergency or family care.4
On August 12, 2014, Ms. Smith sustained the charges in the proposed suspension and issued a decision that Plaintiff be suspended for seven days without pay.
On October 7, 2014, Plaintiff met with two members of the Reasonable Accommodations Committee, Beth Lee and George Medina. Plaintiff requested that she be transferred to a different [*7]  supervisor, as a solution to the harassment.5 The members of the committee determined that Plaintiff had a disability and she was capable of the essential functions of her position. Therefore, she did not qualify for a reasonable accommodation, as she was qualified without reasonable accommodation. The committee offered three alternative options: transfer to the night shift, mediation, and Plaintiff listing the specific behaviors that were objectionable. Plaintiff rejected the alternative options because she had previously gone to the night shift, attempted mediation, and verbally explained the objectionable behaviors to no avail.
On October 31, 2014, Plaintiff received a proposed fourteen-day suspension. The proposed suspension alleged that Plaintiff failed to follow proper leave request procedures after invoking her FMLA leave. The fact-finding investigation and the proposed suspension were revoked pending investigation of complaints by Plaintiff's co-workers. Three co-workers filed written complaints. It is unclear what these complaints alleged.6
Plaintiff believed these complaints were fabricated or created by Ms. Nunez or Ms. Miller or both. Plaintiff alleged that she received a notice [*8]  of thirty-day suspension7 one hour prior to an interview for a supervisor position, in which she was only competing with one of Ms. Nunez' protégé. Plaintiff believed this was an attempt to sabotage her performance at the interview.
Plaintiff alleged that she was harassed and discriminated against by Sylvia Nunez, Natalie Miller, and Margaret Plummer. She alleges that all of it is related to the mediation from 2010. However, she stated that "everybody went crazy once Natalie [Miller] got there, because Natalie is a documenter and she would document every single thing. Even if it's not worth it, she will document it." (Doc. 61-2 at 50:11-15.) She also stated that Ms. Nunez "already ran two or three people off still to this day. And they filed EEO complaints, too, on her." (Doc. 61-2 at 55:25-56:2.) Plaintiff attributed these behaviors or run-ins to Ms. Nunez' desire for power, and Plaintiff's perceived "weakness" or a perceived personal hatred. (Doc. 61-2 at 55:14-20, 43:21-22.)
Plaintiff did not allege that she was discriminated against because of her race or sex. When asked if the disability was the motivation for the discrimination it appears that Plaintiff did not believe that the [*9]  disability was a motivator, but instead a tool used against her. (Doc. 61-2 at 59:17-25.)8 When Plaintiff was asked why she believed her treatment was because of her disability, she stated that because it was not corrected and that her health was getting worse as a result, she also stated that "they started with the FMLA." (Doc. 61-2 at 83:25.) Ms. Miller did not know Plaintiff's medical condition until late 2014. She knew that Plaintiff was utilizing FMLA leave but did not know the specifics of why. Ms. Plummer stated that she did not know the details of Plaintiff's disability.
On July 31, 2015, Plaintiff retired, which she characterized as a constructive discharge. Plaintiff has a separate administrative claim, which covers the alleged constructive discharge, and therefore, the constructive discharge is not before the Court.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On September 19, 2015, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint, which alleges that the Department of Veterans Affairs violated the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and that the Department of Veterans Affairs interfered with her ability to take Family Medical Leave in violation of the Family Medical Leave Act. [*10]  (Doc. 20.) Specifically, Plaintiff alleged that she was discriminated against due to her prior Equal Employment Opportunity ("EEO") actions and her disability based on depression and anxiety disorder, and that she suffered disparate treatment, and a hostile work environment. She claimed the discrimination was based on various disciplinary punishments that she received, some of which were rescinded, that a position that she interviewed for and was offered was retracted, and the denial of her request for reasonable accommodation.
Defendant filed an answer to the Amended Complaint denying that Plaintiff was singled out or discriminated against. (Doc. 24.) On June 8, 2018, Defendant filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 60). The time for Plaintiff to respond has expired without any response.9

STANDARD OF REVIEW
A court must grant summary judgment "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The movant bears the initial responsibility of presenting the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the record, together with affidavits, if any, that it believes demonstrate the [*11]  absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.
If the movant meets its initial responsibility, the burden shifts to the nonmovant to demonstrate the existence of a factual dispute and that the fact in contention is material, i.e., a fact that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law, and that the dispute is genuine, i.e., the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmovant. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 250, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); see Triton Energy Corp. v. Square D. Co., 68 F.3d 1216, 1221 (9th Cir. 1995). The nonmovant need not establish a material issue of fact conclusively in its favor, First Nat'l Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Serv. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 288-89, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1968); however, it must "come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (internal citation omitted); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1).
At summary judgment, the judge's function is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth, but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. In its analysis, the court must believe the nonmovant's evidence and draw all inferences in the nonmovant's favor. Id. at 255. The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider any other materials in the record. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3).

LEGAL STANDARDS

Title VII
Title VII forbids employers from discriminating based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2; Vasquez v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 349 F.3d 634, 642 (9th Cir. 2003), as amended (Jan. 2, 2004). [*12] 
Title VII utilizes a burden shifting structure for disparate treatment or discrimination claims. Vasquez, 349 F.3d at 640. The plaintiff has the initial burden to establish a prima facie case by providing sufficient evidence that "gives rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination." Id. (quoting Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). A prima facie case consists of: (1) plaintiff belonged to a protected class based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, (2) that the plaintiff was qualified, (3) that plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, and (4) that non-class members in similar situations were treated with more favor than the plaintiff. Id. at 648. If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case the defendant has the burden of production to articulate "a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its allegedly discriminatory conduct." Id. at 640. If the defendant is successful in providing a legitimate reason, then the plaintiff has the burden of showing that the reason provided by the defendant is pretextual. Id.
A claim of disparate impact under Title VII requires that plaintiff show "a significant disparate impact on a protected class caused by a specific, identified, employment practice or selection criterion." Stout v. Potter, 276 F.3d 1118, 1121 (9th Cir. 2002). "It is not sufficient to [*13]  present evidence raising an inference of discrimination on a disparate impact claim. The plaintiff must actually prove the discriminatory impact at issue." Id. (internal citation omitted).
Title VII provides a retaliation claim with a similar burden shifting structure as a disparate treatment claim. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3; Vasquez, 349 F.3d at 646. The plaintiff has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case. Vasquez, 349 F.3d at 646. A prima facie case consists of: (1) the plaintiff participated in a protected activity under Title VII,10 (2) that the plaintiff experienced adverse employment action, and (3) that the adverse employment action was motivated by the participation in the protected activity. Id. In this context adverse employment action refers to any treatment that is reasonably likely to deter the plaintiff or others from participating in protected activities. Id. Then it follows the burden shifts much like a disparate treatment claim. Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1064 (9th Cir. 2002).
A Title VII hostile work environment claim requires that the plaintiff prove the following: (1) that the plaintiff was the recipient of harassing verbal or physical conduct, (2) that the conduct was unwelcomed and caused by the plaintiff's membership of a protected class or the plaintiff's protected [*14]  activity, and (3) that the conduct was severe or pervasive enough to change the victim's employment conditions. Arizona ex rel. Horne v. Geo Grp., Inc., 816 F.3d 1189, 1206 (9th Cir. 2016).
Title VII does not protect the employee from discrimination unrelated to protected status or activity. Vasquez, 349 F.3d at 654 (Ferguson, J., dissenting) ("It is beyond dispute that a personality conflict is insufficient to trigger the protections of Title VII."); see Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006).

Rehabilitation Act/ADA
The Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 791, et seq., and not the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., ("ADA") applies to employees in the federal sector. See Boyd v. U.S. Postal Serv., 752 F.2d 410, 412 (9th Cir. 1985). The Rehabilitation Act incorporates the standards applied under the ADA. 29 U.S.C. § 791(f); Coons v. Sec'y of U.S. Dep't of Treasury, 383 F.3d 879, 884 (9th Cir. 2004). The Rehabilitation Act forbids discrimination based on disability in federal employment Boyd, 752 F.2d at 412.
The Rehabilitation Act claim for disparate treatment utilizes a similar burden shifting structure as Title VII. See Lucero v. Hart, 915 F.2d 1367, 1371 (9th Cir. 1990). The initial burden is on the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case. Id. A prima facie case requires that the plaintiff show the following: (1) that the plaintiff worked for a covered entity, (2) that the plaintiff had a disability, (3) that the plaintiff was "otherwise qualified," (4) the covered employer took an adverse action against the plaintiff, and (5) that adverse action was because of plaintiff's [*15]  disability. Walton v. United States Marshals Serv., 492 F.3d 998, 1005 (9th Cir. 2007). The defendant has the burden of production to show that there was a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action. Lucero, 915 F.2d at 1371.
The confines of a disparate impact claim under Rehabilitation Act are less than clear. John Douglas, HIV Disease and Disparate Impact Under the Americans with Disabilities Act: A Federal Prohibition of Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation?, 16 Berkeley J. Emp. & Lab. L. 288, 297 (1995). If the claim is as extensive as a Title VII claim, which is the most generous to plaintiffs, it would require the plaintiff to show "a significant disparate impact on a protected class caused by a specific, identified, employment practice or selection criterion." Stout, 276 F.3d at 1121. "It is not sufficient to present evidence raising an inference of discrimination on a disparate impact claim. The plaintiff must actually prove the discriminatory impact at issue." Id. (internal citation omitted).
Retaliation under the Rehabilitation Act requires the plaintiff to show "(1) involvement in a protected activity, (2) an adverse employment action and (3) a causal link between the two." Coons, 383 F.3d at 887 (quoting Brown v. City of Tucson, 336 F.3d 1181, 1187 (9th Cir. 2003)). This requires that the plaintiff "must present 'evidence adequate to create an inference that an employment decision was based [*16]  on an illegal discriminatory criterion.'" Id. (quoting O'Connor v. Consol. Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U.S. 308, 312, 116 S. Ct. 1307, 134 L. Ed. 2d 433 (1996)). The defendant then has "the burden to 'present legitimate reasons for the adverse employment action.'" Id. (quoting Brooks v. City of San Mateo, 229 F.3d 917, 928 (9th Cir. 2000)). The plaintiff can survive a motion for summary judgment by "demonstrate[ing] a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the reason advanced by the employer was a pretext, then the retaliation case proceeds beyond the summary judgment stage." Id.
It is unclear if ADA or the Rehabilitation Act provides a hostile work environment claim, but assuming there is a claim it would mirror the Title VII elements. Brown, 336 F.3d at 1190. Therefore, the plaintiff would need to provide sufficient showing "that a reasonable person would find [their work environment was] hostile or abusive," and that the ill-treatment was based on their disability or protected activity. Garity v. APWU Nat'l Labor Org., 655 F. App'x 523 (9th Cir. 2016) (internal citation omitted).
Neither the ADA nor the Rehabilitation Act protects employees from discrimination unrelated to protected activity or disability. Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 52, 124 S. Ct. 513, 157 L. Ed. 2d 357 (2003); Mustafa v. Clark Cty. Sch. Dist., 157 F.3d 1169, 1175 (9th Cir. 1998).

Reasonable Accommodation
A prima facie case for failure to provide reasonable accommodation requires plaintiffs to show that (1) they are disabled within the meaning of the statute, (2) the employer knows of the disability [*17]  or need for accommodation, (3) they are qualified individuals able to perform essential functions with or without reasonable accommodations, and (4) the employer denied reasonable accommodation. See Buckingham v. United States, 998 F.2d 735, 739-40 (9th Cir. 1993); Fuller v. Frank, 916 F.2d 558, 561 (9th Cir. 1990); Lucero, 915 F.2d at 1372. "[E]mployers are not relieved of their duty to accommodate when employees are already able to perform the essential functions of the job. Qualified handicapped employees who can perform all job functions may require reasonable accommodation to allow them to (a) enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment equal to those enjoyed by non-handicapped employees or (b) pursue therapy or treatment for their handicaps. In other words, an employer is obligated not to interfere, either through action or inaction, with a handicapped employee's efforts to pursue a normal life." Buckingham, 998 F.2d at 739. The burden then shifts to the defendant to show that the accommodation is either unreasonable or would cause undue hardship. Id. at 743.
It is also important to note that "an employer is not required to find another job for an employee who is not qualified for the job he or she was doing[.]" Voytek v. Univ. of Cal., No. C-92-3465 EFL, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12453, 1994 WL 478805, at *12 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 25, 1994), aff'd, 77 F.3d 491 (9th Cir. 1996). "An employer is not required to [*18]  provide the exact accommodation that an employee requests, as the right to a reasonable accommodation does not entitle a disabled employee to the best accommodation or even to the accommodation of [his or] her choosing." Houston v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., No. C 04-4443 PJH, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27644, 2006 WL 1141238, at *29 (N.D. Cal. May 1, 2006). While, reassignment to a different position is ordinarily considered a reasonable accommodation, 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(2)(ii), this accommodation is largely limited to available positions, US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 416, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002). It is generally agreed that transfer from a supervisor is not a reasonable accommodation. Lu v. Longs Drug Stores, No. CIV. 11-00563 DKW, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147711, 2013 WL 5607166, at *4 (D. Haw. Oct. 11, 2013) (citing case law and EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Question 33 (EEOC Notice No. 915.002, Oct. 17, 2002)).
If an employer does not accept an accommodation proposal and a reasonable accommodation is possible, the employer is obligated to participate in an interactive process with the employee to explore the reasonableness of the proposed accommodation and potential alternatives. Snapp v. United Transp. Union, 889 F.3d 1088, 1097 (9th Cir. 2018).

Interference with FMLA Leave
The Family Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq., ("FMLA") prohibits employers from interfering with, retraining, [*19]  or denying the exercise of or the attempted exercise of the rights provided by the FMLA or to discriminate against any individual for opposing practices prohibited by the statute. 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a). An interference claim requires the plaintiff to show that "(1) he [or she] was eligible for the FMLA's protections, (2) his [or her] employer was covered by the FMLA, (3) he [or she] was entitled to leave under the FMLA, (4) he [or she] provided sufficient notice of his [or her] intent to take leave, and (5) his [or her] employer denied him FMLA benefits to which he [or she] was entitled." Escriba v. Foster Poultry Farms, Inc., 743 F.3d 1236, 1243 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Sanders v. City of Newport, 657 F.3d 772, 778 (9th Cir. 2011)). This does not fall under a burden shifting analysis. Bachelder v. Am. W. Airlines, Inc., 259 F.3d 1112, 1125 (9th Cir. 2001).
A prima facie case of discrimination would require the plaintiff to show that he or she opposed some practice made illegal by the FMLA. Ormsby v. Sunbelt Rentals, Inc., 205 F. Supp. 3d 1204, 1210 (D. Or. 2016) (citing Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1124).

ANALYSIS
Plaintiff failed to present any indication of a causal connection between the adverse employment actions and protected activity, race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, as required by Title VII, or her disability or protected activity, as required by the Rehabilitation Act/ADA. See 29 U.S.C. § 791, et seq.; 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2; 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq.; Walton, 492 F.3d at 1005 (Rehabilitation Act); Vasquez, 349 F.3d at 642 (Title VII). Plaintiff stated in her amended complaint that the protected activity was a prior EEO activity. (Doc. 20.) [*20]  The only activity presented to the Court was a mediation between Plaintiff and Sylvia Nunez and a vague reference to an EEO claim in 2013. There was no allegation that this mediation or EEO claim was to prevent Title VII or Rehabilitation Act/ADA violations. Further, the need for mediation indicated that there was friction between Plaintiff and Ms. Nunez prior to the EEO activity. Plaintiff, in the available deposition, indicated that the friction was due to factors not related to protected activity, race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or disability. (Doc. 61-2 at 55:14-20, 43:21-22.)
Plaintiff failed to present evidence regarding a disparate impact. She did not present any indication that she was bringing a disparate impact claim, but to the extent she was, it failed.
Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact. The Court finds that Defendant would prevail as a matter of law. Therefore, the Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted as to the Title VII and Rehabilitation Act/ADA claims.
When considering the failure to provide reasonable accommodation claim, it appears from the briefing that there were no available positions that Plaintiff would accept where [*21]  the supervision was not the same as her current position. Based on the undisputed material facts, the requested reasonable accommodation was unreasonable.
Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact. The Court finds that Defendant would prevail as a matter of law. Therefore, the Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted as to the failure to provide reasonable accommodation claim.
There is no indication that Plaintiff was denied FMLA leave or that she opposed practices prohibited by FMLA. Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact. The Court finds that Defendant would prevail as a matter of law. Therefore, the Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted as to the FMLA claim.

CONCLUSION
IT IS ORDERED that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 60) is granted.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this case is dismissed without prejudice. The Clerk of the Court shall enter judgment and close this matter.
Dated this 4th day of March, 2019.
