REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
LOCKE, Magistrate Judge:
Presently before the Court, on referral from the Honorable Joseph F. Bianco for Report and Recommendation, is Defendants' L.I. Child and Family Development Services Inc. (the "School"), Arlene Lacey ("Lacey"), and Carmen B. Ruiz ("Ruiz," collectively, "Defendants") Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff pro se Caroline Blair's ("Blair" or "Plaintiff") Complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure ("Fed. R. Civ. P.") 12(b)(6) and 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), which governs the dismissal of proceedings in forma pauperis.1 See Docket Entry ("DE") [9]. By way of Complaint filed March 30, 2016, Plaintiff commenced this action alleging claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 [*2]  ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12112 et seq., and the New York State Human Rights Law, ("NYSHRL"), N.Y. Exec. L. § 290 et seq. Defendants the School, Lacey, and Ruiz subsequently moved to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety, and Defendant Lisa Cornell ("Cornell") has never appeared in this action. See Complaint ("Compl."), DE [1, 9].2 According to the initial briefing schedule set by Judge Bianco, Plaintiff's opposition to the motion was due on or before August 2, 2016. See DE [8]. When Blair did not oppose the motion by that date, this Court sua sponte extended it to January 4, 2017. Electronic Order dated 12/20/2016. Nonetheless, Plaintiff never opposed the motion, and on January 23, 2017, Defendants submitted a letter requesting that the Motion to Dismiss be granted due to a lack of opposition. See DE [13].
For the reasons set forth herein, the Court recommends that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss be granted, but that Blair be given leave to amend the Complaint.

I. BACKGROUND

A. Relevant Facts
The following facts are taken from the Complaint, assumed true for the purposes of this motion, and construed in the light most favorable for Plaintiff.3 For the sake of a complete record the Court notes that Plaintiff's allegations are difficult to [*3]  follow.
1. Blair's Illnesses
On April 10, 2010, Plaintiff Blair began her employment as a "New York certified Teacher" for Defendant L.I. Child and Development Center, a school located on Long Island.4 See Compl. at 10. As a recent "Adelphi Graduate," she left a former "comfortable" job at Bay Shore Middle School for this position. Id. The other Defendants in this action are employees of the School, including Lacey, the Human Resources Manager, Ruiz, Plaintiff's Benefits Administrator, and Cornell, the "Center Manager." Id.
Within a few months working at the School, Plaintiff contracted a staph infection and in the fall of 2010 was "aggressively" treated with medication. Id. Afterwards, she was told by an unidentified director that the School is typically treated for extermination each summer, but was not in 2010, and that "we were being eaten up my [sic] bugs." Id. Other coworkers confirmed the bugs as a "common problem," and Blair identifies them as the cause and source of her infection. Id. at 10-11. She also claims that she had no idea about the "infectious bugs" when she was working at the School, only learning of them after she had been treated for her infection. Id. at 10-11. Due to her "disgust," Plaintiff [*4]  was instructed by her supervisor, Laverne Foster ("Foster"), to write to "Administrative Superior" Annette Harris ("Harris") to explain "how poorly the circumstance was handled and how little alarm or concern for the children and her were given by Respondent [Defendants] and that she was disgusted."5 Id. at 11. It is unclear based on the Complaint whether Blair sent this letter.
Plaintiff then jumps to November 2012. At that time, she was treated at Good Samaritan Hospital for an asthma attack and diagnosed with "[a]sthma-w/acute exacerbation," a disease "[s]he was not born with" and did not suffer from until she began working at the School in Bay Shore. Id. Based on her knowledge of "what she was exposed to at" the School, she believes that she developed asthma due to her place of employment, asserting that the "working conditions directly caused her to now have a diagnosed disability." Id. She reported her concern to Foster, and was told by "[n]early all" other employees that they, too, developed upper respiratory issues due to working at the School. Id. Blair then directly reported her concerns to "the Union . . . in hopes for protection." Id. In January 2013, Plaintiff was again treated by a doctor for [*5]  "extensive sinus fluid/Chronic Sinusitis." Id.
Blair mentions that "Indoor Air Quality Solutions" came to the School to test the environment and briefly asserts that the "employees later received the shocking dreadful results." Id. She does not, however, explain when this testing occurred, when the employees learned of the results, or the substance of what the employees learned that was so "shocking" or "dreadful." Id.
2. Subsequent Transfer and Educational Leave
Plaintiff was later transferred to another location, which, from what the Court can gather, was in Huntington Station, New York. Id. at 11-12. She explains that she was moved "from a terrible center as described herein to the worst work site location available to" the School, and that the transfer site was "literally a cellar filled with mold and leaks." Id. at 12. Moreover, the transfer resulted in a forty-five minute commute, as compared to her previous commute which was two minutes from her home and children's schools and the "primary purpose" she took the job at the School. Id. She believes that this transfer was in retaliation for her formal complaints and reasonable request that the school clean up the contamination. Id. at 11-12. After the transfer, she [*6]  formally complained to the Human Resources Department about the "unsafe disability causing working conditions" on at least twelve different occasions, but that the School "with discriminatory and retaliatory intent, did nothing." Id. at 12.
Blair's timeline of this transfer is unclear. She initially explains that she was transferred "that Summer," presumably referring to summer 2013. Id. at 11. She later identifies the date of the "retaliatory transfer" as "on or about September 16, 2013." Id. at 12. However, she also explains that she requested an educational leave on August 8, 2013 to return to work on January 2, 2014, which was granted. Id. Based on this timeline, the Court assumes that Plaintiff was transferred at some point in the summer of 2013 prior to the school year, but, due to Blair's educational leave, cannot say with certainty whether Plaintiff worked at the second site at the beginning of the 2013-2014 school year.
3. Return to the School
Blair returned to the School after her educational leave on January 2, 2014. Id. Within a few hours, she was sent home by Cornell because "her PPD had expired," which the Court assumes is the "purified protein derivative" exam used by doctors to test an individual's [*7]  skin for tuberculosis. Id. As a result, her "benefits were cut." Id.
Plaintiff's recitation of the events over the course of the next month are hazy. On January 6, 2014, Blair emailed Ruiz requesting that her benefits be reinstated. Id. This request was denied until the PPD was completed, an act Plaintiff believes was "a further act of retaliation." Id. at 13. She and Ruiz continued to correspond by email from January 17, 2014 through January 31, 2014, at which point her benefits were reinstated but "in a further act of retaliation" were cut "shortly thereafter." Id. Apparently, Blair was pregnant at this time and "needed those benefits" but was denied "with further retaliatory motive." Id. She also explains that she was "subjected to fabricated disciplinary actions" including being told to not come to work, but then written up for not showing up. Id. Furthermore, on January 23, 2014, her doctor sent a letter to the School detailing Plaintiff's medical condition and "demand[ing]" that it transfer Blair to another location "to ensure that her health would not continue to deteriorate, which would inevitably impact the health of her unborn son . . . ." Id. at 15.
On February 4, 2014, Plaintiff had a conference call [*8]  with Lacey and Harris which resulted in her returning to work at the Huntington Station location on February 6, 2014. Id. at 13. When Blair returned, she again complained about the unsafe conditions. Id. She was told by Lacey to contact her directly because Lacey "had reason to 'question' [Blair's] concerns." Id. Moreover, she asserts that Lacey, in a further act of retaliation and intimidation, told Plaintiff that she "reported her to unemployment, and . . . just wanted to let [her] know that." Id.
On her first day back on February 6, 2014, Blair contacted Lacey and told her that the "facilities were toxic, as the ceiling was falling down on her, it was leaking" and that "hanging from the ceiling were exposed electrical wires and that the classroom was flooded and the boiler was leaking gas." Id. at 14. Lacey responded "what do you want me to do" and Cornell directed Plaintiff, who at this point was eight months pregnant, to "get on top of a chair and patch the ceiling." Id. The next day, she described further "adverse retaliatory treatment" by Cornell, including telling Blair on February 7, 2014 that when "Licensing" was coming to "keep her mouth shut," and calling her over the weekend and instructing [*9]  her not to come to work the following Monday, February 9, 2014 because "Licensing" was coming and Plaintiff's physical was not accurate. Id. Blair explains that her paperwork was correct but nonetheless she was "harassed" by Cornell to complete it. Id.
On February 12, 2014, Plaintiff was written up by Cornell for wearing slippers to work and subsequently was placed on disciplinary notice. Id. Apparently, Blair explained that her feet were swollen because she was in her last trimester of pregnancy and asked Cornell about the paperwork her doctor sent to the School dated January 23, 2014, which detailed her medical condition. Id. She was told that the School had received it and was "working on it." Id. Two days later, Plaintiff claims that her union director advised her that the School "was 'after her' and to 'get out of there.' " Id.
4. Leave and Loss of Benefits
On February 17, 2014, two weeks after Plaintiff returned to work, Blair's doctor sent a note to the School marking Plaintiff "totally disabled, with a respiratory tract disorder," and indicated that she had to be out of work for the next four weeks. Id. at 15. The following week on February 28, Blair received "a request for FMLA leave [*10]  packet from [the School]." Id. Feeling "threatened and uncertain what to do, she telephoned disability," and was advised that she would need to apply for Workers' Compensation benefits because she sustained a work-related disability. Id. Her doctor subsequently sent another letter dated March 20, 2014, indicating that Blair must be out of work for another four weeks until April 21, 2014, amounting to eight consecutive weeks. Id. Plaintiff's baby was born on April 22, 2014. Id.
Although not expressly stated by Blair, it appears as if Plaintiff was not covered by health insurance while on this eight-week leave. For example, she asserts that beginning in March 2014 she continuously attempted to "have her health insurance reinstated" as she was "continuously denied health insurance for herself and her family including no health care for the birth of her son on April 22, 2014." Id. at 16. She also claims that she faced other consequences in "direct retaliation" due to her "disability and reasonable accommodation requests" during this period. Id. For example, in March 2014, she received "several letters" that threatened termination and told her not to come onto the School's property "despite her still [*11]  being employee [sic]." Id. She believes that she was "forced to be on an unpaid leave due to [Defendants'] inability to position her at another [School] location." Id.
Plaintiff also explains fragments of events that occurred over the next few months. On May 1, 2014, she reached out to the School regarding her medical status and, for the first time, "inquired of her short term disability." Id. The School indicated that it would "send out" her request for short term disability. Id. A hearing was held on May 5, although Blair does not explain what for, but she could not attend as it "was just days after having leaving the hospital and delivering a nearly ten (10) pound baby." Id. at 15. She explains that as of June 2014, all her paperwork regarding her medical condition was sent by her doctor to the School. Id. at 16. That following October, she sent another letter to the School explaining that she has spent "a substantial amount of time in Hospitals with her newborn son" who suffers from "acute medical conditions," which she detailed for Defendants. Id. at 15. As a result of this letter, she alleges that she faced "[m]ore [unidentified] retaliation." Id.
Plaintiff's allegations end with a section titled "Charging Party's [*12]  Rational Basis For Believing There Was Discrimination and Retaliation Against Her." Id. at 16. She asserts that Defendants clearly engaged in gender and disability discrimination based on the following two statements/phrases: "[f]ear of exposure" and "[l]et's get rid of the pregnant woman before this gets worst [sic] . . . ." Id. at 16-17. She does not, however, elaborate on who made the statements, when they were said, or in what context. She further notes that the "ongoing threats of terminating" her demonstrate a "pretext and retaliatory animus." Id. at 17. Blair does not allege that she was terminated.

B. Procedural Background
Based on the foregoing events, Plaintiff filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") on December 19, 2014. See Compl. ¶ IV.A. The EEOC was "unable to conclude that the information obtained establishes violations of the statutes," and Blair received a Notice of Suit Rights dated December 31, 2015. See id. at 18 ("Dismissal and Notice of Rights"). Plaintiff commenced this action on March 30, 2016, asserting that Defendants discriminated and retaliated against her in violation of Title VII, the ADA, and the NYSHRL, due to her gender, because she was pregnant, and on account of her [*13]  asthma and skin infection disabilities. Id. at ¶¶ II-III. For her harm, she seeks actual, compensatory, punitive, and emotional distress damages. Id. at ¶ V. As set forth above, Defendants, with the exception of Cornell who has yet to appear, moved to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety, which, despite two separate deadlines set by this Court, has gone unopposed by Blair. See DE [8, 9]; Electronic Order dated 12/20/2016. Judge Bianco referred the motion to this Court on October 7, 2016 for a Report and Recommendation. See DE [11].

II. LEGAL STANDARDS

A. Rule 12(b)(6) Standard
In order to survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), a complaint must contain "sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' " Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1940, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1960, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). A claim is considered plausible on its face "when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 678, 129 S. Ct. at 1949. In deciding a motion to dismiss, "a court must 'accept all allegations in the complaint as true and draw all inferences in the non-moving party's favor.' " U.S. ex rel. Siegel v. Roche Diagnostics Corp., 988 F. Supp. 2d 341, 343 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (quoting LaFaro v. N.Y. Cardiothoracic Grp., PLLC, 570 F.3d 471, 475 (2d Cir. 2009)). In deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the court's consideration [*14]  is limited to:
(1) the factual allegations in the complaint, which are accepted as true;
(2) documents attached to the complaint as an exhibit or incorporated . . . by reference; (3) matters of which judicial notice may be taken; and
(4) documents upon whose terms and effect the complaint relies heavily, i.e., documents that are "integral" to the complaint.
Calcutti v. SBU, Inc., 273 F. Supp. 2d 488, 498 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (internal citation omitted).
Moreover, in analyzing an unopposed motion to dismiss, the Second Circuit has explained that a Court is to "assume the truth of a pleading's factual allegations and test only its legal sufficiency." McCall v. Pataki, 232 F.3d 321, 322-23 (2d Cir. 2000). To that end, "although a party is of course to be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to an opponent's motion, the sufficiency of a complaint is a matter of law that the court is capable of determining based on its own reading of the pleading and knowledge of the law. If a complaint is sufficient to state a claim on which relief can be granted, the plaintiff's failure to respond to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion does not warrant dismissal." Id.; see also Joseph v. Nassau Cty. Corr. Facility, No. 15CV7010, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69512, 2016 WL 3033725, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. May 26, 2016).

B. Pro se Pleadings
It is well-established that pleadings by pro se plaintiffs are held "to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers." Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 9, 101 S. Ct. 173, 66 L. Ed. 2d 163 (1980); see also [*15]  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007) ("A document filed pro se is to be liberally construed, and a pro se complaint, however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.") (internal citations omitted). The Second Circuit has held that a court reviewing a pro se complaint must "construe the complaint broadly, and interpret it to raise the strongest arguments that it suggests." Weixel v. Bd. of Educ. of the City of New York, 287 F.3d 138, 146 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal alterations omitted); see also Rene v. Citibank N.A., 32 F. Supp. 2d 539, 541 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) (holding that a court must "make reasonable allowances so that . . . pro se plaintiffs do not forfeit their rights by virtue of their lack of legal training."). However, the court "need not argue a pro se litigant's case nor create a case for the pro se which does not exist." Ogunmokun v. Am. Educ. Servs./PHEAA, No. 12-CV-4403, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134098, 2014 WL 4724707, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 23, 2014) (quoting Molina v. New York, 956 F. Supp. 257, 259 (E.D.N.Y. 1995)).

C. McDonnell Douglas Burden-Shifting Framework
Causes of action under Title VII, the ADA, and the NYSHRL are analyzed using the burden-shifting framework articulated by the United States Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See, e.g., Ruiz v. County of Rockland, 609 F.3d 486, 491 (2d Cir. 2010) (examining Title VII claims under McDonnell Douglas framework); McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., 583 F.3d 92, 96 (2d Cir. 2009) (examining ADA claims under McDonnell Douglas framework); Brown v. Northrop Grumman Corp., 12-cv-1488, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116188, 2014 WL 4175795, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 19, 2014) (noting that claims under the ADA, Title VII, and the NYSHRL are analyzed using the [*16]  McDonnell Douglas framework); Lew v. Radiation Dynamics, 995 F. Supp. 106, 112 (E.D.N.Y. 1998) (examining Title VII allegations under McDonnell Douglas framework).
Under this analysis, a plaintiff must "first establish a prima facie case, after which the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action." Brown, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116188, 2014 WL 4175795, at *5 (citing Holcomb v. Iona Coll., 521 F.3d 130, 138 (2d Cir. 2008)). "Once the defendant provides such a reason, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to present competent evidence that the reasons offered by the Defendant were not the true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination or retaliation." Id. (citing Fleming v. MaxMara USA, Inc., 371 F. App'x 115, 117 (2d Cir. 2010); see also Abrams v. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 764 F.3d 244, 251 (2d Cir. 2014) ("Under McDonnell Douglas, a plaintiff bears the initial burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination; it is then the defendant's burden to proffer a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its actions; the final and ultimate burden is on the plaintiff to establish that the defendant's reason is in fact pretext for unlawful discrimination.").

III. DISCUSSION
With these standards in mind, the Court turns to the merits of Defendants' motion. According to them, certain claims are time-barred and Plaintiff's other allegations fail to support any entitlement to relief.6 For [*17]  the reasons set forth below, the Court recommends that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss be granted in its entirety, but that Blair be given leave to amend her Complaint.

A. Conversion to a Motion for Summary Judgment
In connection with their motion, Defendants have submitted an affidavit and accompanying exhibits that were not attached to the original Complaint. See Affidavit in Support ("Lacey Aff."), DE [9-3]. On a 12(b)(6) motion, "[i]f matters outside the pleadings are presented to the court, a court may convert the motion to dismiss into a summary judgment motion." Vailette v. Lindsay, No. 11-CV-3610, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114701, 2014 WL 4101513, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 18, 2014); see also Friedl v. City of N.Y., 210 F.3d 79, 83 (2d Cir. 2000) ("When matters outside the pleadings are presented in response to a 12(b)(6) motion, a district court must either exclude the additional material and decide the motion on the complaint alone or convert the motion to one for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 and afford all parties the opportunity to present supporting material.") (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Although the court "must ordinarily give notice to the parties" before conversion, "a party 'is deemed to have notice that a motion may be converted ... if that party should reasonably have recognized the possibility that such a conversion would occur.' [*18]  " Almonte v. Pub. Storage Inc., No. 11 CIV. 1404, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99840, 2011 WL 3902997, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 2, 2011) (quoting Sira v. Morton, 380 F.3d 57, 68 (2d Cir. 2004)); see also In re G. & A. Books, Inc., 770 F.2d 288, 295 (2d Cir. 1985) ("The essential inquiry is whether [the party] should reasonably have recognized the possibility that the motion might be converted into one for summary judgment or was taken by surprise and deprived of a reasonable opportunity to meet facts outside the pleadings.").
Whether or not to convert the motion is in the District Court's discretion. See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. N. Picco & Sons Contracting Co., No. 05 CIV. 217, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4915, 2008 WL 190310, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 16, 2008) ("It is within the discretion of this Court to convert a motion filed under Rule 12(b)(6) into a motion seeking summary judgment when matters outside the pleadings have been presented and accepted by the Court, and where all parties have been given a reasonable opportunity to present materials pertinent to the motion's disposition.") (internal quotation marks omitted); Scope, Inc. v. Pataki, 386 F. Supp. 2d 184, 190 (W.D.N.Y. 2005) ("The Court determines in its discretion, however, not to convert these motions on the pleadings to ones for summary judgment at this time."); Staveley v. St. Charles Hosp., 173 F.R.D. 49, 51 (E.D.N.Y. 1997) ("In its discretion and upon notice to the parties, a court may consider materials outside the pleadings. If it does so, and notice is given to the parties, the motion for judgment on the pleadings is treated as one for summary judgment."). In exercising [*19]  this discretion, Courts "look[] to the substance of the motion," Ansonia Tenants' Coal., Inc. v. Ansonia Assocs., 163 F.R.D. 468, 470 (S.D.N.Y. 1995), as "[t]he element that triggers the conversion . . . is a challenge to the sufficiency of the pleader's claim supported by extra-pleading material." Nat'l Cement Co. v. Mead Corp., 80 F.R.D. 703, 704-05 (S.D.N.Y. 1978) (citing 9 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 1366, at 676)).
Here, the Court declines to exercise its discretion to convert this motion into one for summary judgment. Defendants did place Plaintiff on notice of the potential conversion, providing her with the full text of Rule 56 and warning that the Complaint may be dismissed if she does not respond by filing sworn affidavits. See Notice to Pro Se Litigant Who Opposes A Rule 12 Motion Supported by Matters Outside the Pleadings ("Rule 12 Notice"), DE [9-1]. Nonetheless, conversion is improper. Defendants' extra-pleading material consists of a two-and-half page affidavit by Lacey with eight exhibits that only cover a portion of the events alleged by Blair. See Lacey Aff. Thus, the record before the Court even with the affidavit is devoid of evidence regarding large chunks of Plaintiff's claims. See, e.g., FragranceNet.com, Inc. v. Les Parfums, Inc., 672 F. Supp. 2d 328, 334 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (declining conversion where "there is nothing for the Court to consider, in terms of evidence from the defendants, if it were to convert [*20]  the motion to dismiss into a summary judgment motion."). Moreover, Defendants neither include a Rule 56.1 statement nor advocate for summary judgment in their brief. See Defendants' Memorandum of Law ("Def.'s Mem. Law"), DE [9-2]. For these reasons, and also as discovery has yet to commence in this action, the Court recommends that the Motion to Dismiss not be converted to one for summary judgment. See Stephens v. Bayview Nursing & Rehab. Ctr., No. 07-CV-0596, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20792, 2008 WL 728896, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 17, 2008) ("Here, in its broad discretion, and under the circumstances of this case, the Court finds that conversion to summary judgment is inappropriate and that further discovery in this case is necessary at this juncture."); Cassotto v. Potter, No. CIVA3-07-CV-266, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53240, 2007 WL 2121239, at *1 (D. Conn. July 20, 2007) ("The court will not at this time convert the defendant's motion into one for summary judgment, and therefore denies the motion to dismiss without prejudice to raise these arguments on summary judgment."); Wajilam Exports (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. v. ATL Shipping Ltd., 475 F. Supp. 2d 275, 278 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) ("There would be little point in considering a summary judgment motion when significant relevant facts may yet be discovered."). As such, the Court declines to consider the Lacey Affidavit and accompanying exhibits, as well as facts in Defendants' motion papers not alleged in the Complaint, in determining this motion. See Patell Indus. Mach. Co. v. Toyoda Mach. U.S.A., Inc., No. 93-CV-1572, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 306, 1997 WL 10972, at *2 (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 1997) ("The Court, [*21]  however, declines to convert Defendant's motion to a motion for summary judgment, and therefore will not consider Plaintiff's affidavit in ruling upon the merits of Defendant's Rule 12(c) motion.").

B. Federal Claims
Plaintiff alleges causes of action for gender and disability discrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environment pursuant to Title VII and the ADA, as well as failure to accommodate her disability under the ADA.7 Defendants argue that these claims should be dismissed against them as either barred by the statute of limitations or for failure to state a plausible cause of action. For the reasons set forth below, the Court agrees.
1. Individual Liability
At the outset, the Court notes that Blair alleges her claims against three individual employees, as well as the School. However, both Title VII and the ADA prohibit individual liability on behalf of employees. See Spiegel v. Schulmann, 604 F.3d 72, 79 (2d Cir. 2010) ("We have, however, determined that the remedial provisions of Title VII, including § 2000e-5, do not provide for individual liability."); Warshun v. N.Y. Cmty. Bancorp, Inc., 957 F. Supp. 2d 259, 265 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) ("The ADA's prohibition against employment discrimination applies only to employers, employment agencies, labor organizations, and labor-management committees . . . and not against individual [*22]  employees."); Benedith v. Malverne Union Free Sch. Dist., 38 F. Supp. 3d 286, 326 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) ("As the Second Circuit held, Title VII does not provide for individual liability and, therefore, any such claims against the Individual Defendants is dismissed."); Givens v. City of N.Y., No. 11 CIV. 2568, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2892, 2012 WL 75027, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 10, 2012) (stating that discrimination, including failure to accommodate, and retaliation claims under the ADA are not enforceable against individuals); Dawson v. Cty. of Westchester, 351 F. Supp. 2d 176, 192-93 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) ("Accordingly, to the extent that plaintiffs seek to hold the individual defendants liable under Title VII for alleged sexual harassment and creating a hostile work environment, that claim is dismissed."). Accordingly, to the extent the federal claims are lodged against the individual Defendants, the Court recommends that they be dismissed.
2. Statute of Limitations
Under Title VII and the ADA, a plaintiff must file a charge with the EEOC within 300 days from the date of any act of discrimination or retaliation. See Foster v. (D.O.E.) Theatre Arts Prod. Co. Sch., No. 12 CIV. 3661, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10445, 2014 WL 265787, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 24, 2014) ("To timely state a discrimination claim under the ADA, a plaintiff's EEOC complaint must be filed within 300 days of the alleged discriminatory acts."); Borrero v. Am. Exp. Bank Ltd., 533 F. Supp. 2d 429, 435 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) ("Under Title VII, the statute of limitations for filing a charge of discrimination in states such as New York that have an agency with the authority to address charges of discriminatory employment [*23]  practices is 300 days."). "[O]nly incidents that took place within the timely filing period are actionable." Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 114, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 2073, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002). "Each incident of discrimination and each retaliatory adverse employment decision constitutes a separate actionable unlawful employment practice, and each discriminatory act starts a new clock for filing charges alleging that act." Liss v. Nassau Cty., 425 F. Supp. 2d 335, 340 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 536 U.S. at 114, 122 S. Ct. at 2072).
Nonetheless, if certain actions fall outside of the 300-day statute of limitations, "the person can recover for that conduct if it is demonstrated that there was a continuous policy and practice of discrimination, and that one act in furtherance of the policy and practice fell within the 300 day period." Id. at 340 (citing Bonner v. Guccione, 178 F.3d 581, 584 (2d Cir. 1999)). The continuing violation doctrine, however, does not apply to "discrete acts of discrimination, even if they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges." Pietri v. N.Y.S. Office of Court Admin., 936 F. Supp. 2d 120, 134 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Here, Plaintiff asserts in her Complaint that she "was subject to discrimination and retaliation from [April 10, 2010] up to and including now, making this a continuing violation doctrine charge." Compl. at 10. For their part, Defendants urge that all allegations of wrongdoing prior to February 23, [*24]  2014, 300 days prior to the filing of the EEOC charge on December 19, 2014, are time-barred and do not qualify as a continuing violation. See Def.'s Mem. Law at 5. The Court agrees insomuch that all discrete acts of discrimination or retaliation are time-barred if they occurred before February 23, 2014 and are not part of a continuing violation. In reviewing Blair's Complaint, the Court identifies the following allegations of wrongdoing that occurred prior to February 23, 2014, which may be saved only if classified as part of a continuing practice of discrimination: (1) Plaintiff's transfer in September 2013 to the Huntington Station location and the School's subsequent refusal to transfer her back to the original location, see Compl. at 11-12; (2) denying Blair the right to return to work on January 2, 2014 because she did not submit appropriate medical paperwork, id. at 12; (3) cutting Plaintiff's benefits in early January, despite her pregnancy, because she did not submit the correct medical paperwork, id. at 13; (4) reinstating Blair's benefits in mid-January but cutting them again "shortly thereafter," id.; (5) writing Plaintiff up as a "no show" and subjecting her to "fabricated disciplinary actions" [*25]  in January 2014, id.; (6) writing Blair up for wearing slippers to work on February 12, 2014, id. at 14; (7) Lacey informing Plaintiff that she was reporting her to unemployment in early February 2014, id. at 13; (8) Cornell telling Blair to "get on top of a chair and patch the ceiling" while pregnant on February 6, 2014, id. at 14; (9) "harass[ing]" her to complete her medical paperwork, id.; and (10) being told by Cornell to "keep her mouth shut" when licensing came to the School on February 7, 2014, id.
These allegations consist of a series of discrete acts, insufficient to constitute a continuing violation. It is well-established that transfers, no matter how undesirable, are discrete acts, and therefore Blair's allegations of the unlawful transfer in September 2013 and subsequent refusal by the School to transfer her back are time-barred. See Fanelli v. N.Y., 51 F. Supp. 3d 219, 228 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) ("[I]t is well-established that transfers are discrete acts that do not constitute a continuing violation for statute of limitations purposes."); Benjamin v. Brookhaven Sci. Assocs., LLC, 387 F. Supp. 2d 146, 153 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) ("It is well-settled that alleged adverse employment practices such as . . . undesirable work transfers, and denial of preferred job assignments are considered discrete acts."); Crosland v. City of N.Y., 140 F. Supp. 2d 300, 308 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), aff'd sub nom. Crosland v. Safir, 54 F. App'x 504 (2d Cir. 2002) ("It is well-established that transfers, demotions, failure [*26]  to compensate adequately, and failure to promote are all discrete acts which do not constitute a continuing violation."). Moreover, Plaintiff's claims that she was denied health benefits in January, disallowed from returning to work due to a lack of a physical in January, and subject to disciplinary actions for not showing up and wearing slippers in early February are also discrete acts. See Thomson v. Odyssey House, No. 14-CV-3857, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125887, 2015 WL 5561209, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2015), aff'd, 652 F. App'x 44 (2d Cir. 2016) (finding a discrete act where plaintiff was not allowed to return to work); Oyelola v. Hartford Fin. Servs. Grp., Inc., No. 3:12-CV-01685, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14699, 2014 WL 496880, at *9 (D. Conn. Feb. 5, 2014) ("Oyelola's allegations of being under-compensated, demoted, retaliated against, forced to work excessive hours, and denied benefits all involve discrete acts of discrimination."); Gaston v. N.Y. City Dep't of Health Office of Chief Med. Exam'r, 432 F. Supp. 2d 321, 328 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (finding a claim of "denial of rights and benefits of employment" a discrete act). Accordingly, claims of discrimination and retaliation based on these alleged adverse employment actions are time-barred.
Blair's allegations regarding a hostile work environment, however, more closely resemble a continuing violation. "The Second Circuit has recognized the application of the continuing violation doctrine in cases where plaintiffs could provide proof of specific or ongoing [*27]  policies or practices of discrimination that caused their environment-based injuries." Plant v. Deutsche Bank Sec., Inc., No. 07CIV3498, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55100, 2007 WL 2187109, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2007). Beginning with her return to work on February 6 through February 9, 2014, Plaintiff explains that she felt "threatened and intimidated" and subject to "hostile comments," including being told by Lacey that she had reason to "question" Blair's health concerns and that she was reporting Plaintiff to unemployment, being told to "get up on a chair and patch the ceiling" while eight months pregnant, and forewarned to "keep her mouth shut" when "Licensing" came to the School. Compl. at 13-14. Further, she claims that in March 2014, within the actionable time period, she received letters from Defendants "threatening termination and other adverse actions" including telling her not to come onto the School's property. Id. at 16. These purported events, with at least one occurring within the statute of limitations, suggest a pattern of hostility sufficient to constitute a continuing violation. See Germany v. N.Y.S. D.O.C.S., No. 03 CIV. 148, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16640, 2003 WL 22203724, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 22, 2003) ("Unlike a specific discrete event such as a disciplinary action, a hostile work environment continues over time, and is created [*28]  and evidenced by a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one unlawful employment practice."). As such, the Court finds that these allegations are not time-barred to the extent they constitute a hostile work environment. See 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16640, [WL] at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 22, 2003) ("[T]he Court may consider events that occurred before [the date of the statute of limitations], if and to the extent that they are a part of the series of events creating the hostile workplace.") (emphasis in original).
Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the Court respectfully recommends that Plaintiff's claims of discrimination and retaliation based on discrete events set forth above be dismissed as time-barred as to the moving Defendants, though her hostile work environment claims are otherwise timely.
3. Discrimination
Turning to the first substantive cause of action, Blair asserts that she was discriminated against on account of her gender and disabilities. Upon a review of the Complaint, the Court identifies the following allegations of discrimination which are within the pertinent statute of limitations: (1) not mailing Plaintiff any of the "necessary forms" concerning her rights to disability for maternity leave in February 2014, purportedly [*29]  "[d]emonstrating further retaliation and discrimination," Compl. at 168; (2) threatening Blair with termination and other "adverse actions" beginning March 7, 2014, including telling her not to come onto the School's property, id.; (3) continuously denying Plaintiff health insurance after her leave in February including during the birth of her son in April, id.; and (4) that she faced "[m]ore retaliation" when informing Defendants on October 31, 2014 that she was spending a substantial amount of time in the hospital with her newborn son, id. at 15. The Court analyzes whether these claims constitute discrimination in violation of Title VII and the ADA.

i. Title VII
Title VII "aims to remedy discrimination in the workplace on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin . . . ." Harrison v. Potter, 323 F. Supp. 2d 593, 599 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). The statute provides, in relevant part:
It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin . . . .
42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). A plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of [*30]  discrimination by alleging that he or she: "(1) [] is a member of a protected class; (2) [] was qualified for the position he held; (3) [] suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) the adverse action took place under circumstances giving rise to [an] inference of discrimination." Mohamed v. NYU, No. 14CV8373, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68164, 2015 WL 3387218, at *23 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2015), (Report and Recommendation), adopted by 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121178, 2015 WL 5307391 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 2015), reconsideration denied sub nom. Mohamed v. N.Y. Univ., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154152, 2015 WL 7076124 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 12, 2015).
Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to allege a plausible adverse employment action. See Def.'s Mem. Law at 6. To establish an adverse employment action, a plaintiff must allege that he or she sustained a "materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment." Galabya v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., 202 F.3d 636, 640 (2d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Taylor v. New York City Dep't of Educ., No. 11-CV-3582, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170917, 2012 WL 5989874, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 30, 2012). A change in employment is materially adverse if it is "more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration in job responsibilities." Galabya, 202 F.3d at 636 (citation omitted). Courts have found materially adverse changes based on "a termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, [or] significantly diminished material responsibilities . . . ." Id. (citation omitted); see also Taylor, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170917, 2012 WL 5989874, at *7.
As an initial matter, Plaintiff's claim that she was threatened [*31]  with termination and told to remain off the property in March 2014 does not meet this definition. It is well-established that a threat of termination on its own does not rise to the level of an adverse employment action. See Pierre v. Napolitano, 958 F. Supp. 2d 461, 476 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) ("[A] threat of termination, without more, is not an adverse employment action."); Weisbecker v. Sayville Union Free Sch. Dist., 890 F. Supp. 2d 215, 219 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) ("This threat of termination alone, in form of a recommendation by the Superintendent to the Board, does not, by itself constitute an adverse employment action."). Regarding her contention that she was told to remain off the property in March 2014, at that time she was on a doctor-ordered medical leave and was not present at the School. As such, remaining off the property cannot be deemed to have materially changed the terms and conditions of her employment sufficient to constitute an adverse employment action. See Tolbert v. Smith, 790 F.3d 427, 435 (2d Cir. 2015) ("An employee suffers an adverse employment action if he endures a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment. An adverse employment action is one which is more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities.") (internal quotation marks omitted).
Blair's claims regarding her loss of health insurance and that she [*32]  was never sent disability forms also do not establish adverse employment actions as she fails to plead that she was ever entitled to these benefits. The Court recognizes that a refusal to provide certain benefits may constitute an adverse employment action if an employee is entitled to them. See, e.g., Sethi v. Narod, 12 F. Supp. 3d 505, 529 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) ("If Plaintiff was deprived of five paid days of vacation each year to which he was entitled, then Plaintiff suffered a materially adverse impact in the terms and conditions of employment sufficient to establish an adverse employment action."). Nowhere in the Complaint, however, does Plaintiff plead that the School was obligated to provide the benefits as part of the terms of her employment during the relevant time period or on what basis. Rather, based on the facts alleged, it seems as if she was on an eight week leave at the behest of her doctor which extended indefinitely. Without establishing that she was entitled to these benefits as part of her employment, she fails to plausibly plead that the withholding of disability forms and health insurance constitute an adverse employment action. See Mario v. P & C Food Markets, Inc., 313 F.3d 758, 767 (2d Cir. 2002) ("[I]t is not clear that the denial of benefits, without more, constitutes an adverse employment [*33]  action.").
Nonetheless, even assuming arguendo that these events were adverse employment actions, Plaintiff's Title VII discrimination claim cannot withstand a Motion to Dismiss as the Complaint fails to plead the fourth element of a prima facie case: circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. Courts have held that this inference "can arise from circumstances including, but not limited to, 'the employer's criticism of the plaintiff's performance in ethnically degrading terms; or its invidious comments about others in the employee's protected group; or the more favorable treatment of employees not in the protected group; or the sequence of events leading to the plaintiff's discharge.' " See Littlejohn v. City of N.Y., 795 F.3d 297, 312 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Leibowitz v. Cornell Univ., 584 F.3d 487, 502 (2d Cir.2009)). To that end, Courts have held that "a plaintiff must allege that 'she was similarly situated in all material respects to the individuals with whom she seeks to compare herself.' " Brown v. Daikin Am., Inc., 756 F.3d 219, 230 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Graham v. Long Island R.R., 230 F.3d 34, 39 (2d Cir. 2000)). "Moreover, although, [a]t the motion to dismiss stage, ... evidence [of similarly situated comparators] is not necessary[,] ... a court still must determine whether, based on a plaintiff's allegations in the complaint, it is plausible that a jury could ultimately determine that [*34]  the comparators are similarly situated." Weslowski v. Zugibe, 14 F. Supp. 3d 295, 319 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original).
Here, Blair fails to satisfy this standard as she pleads no facts which would constitute direct evidence of discrimination or how she was treated differently than her counterparts. Aside from simply alleging the naked assertion that she was discriminated against by Defendants, there are no factual allegations demonstrating discriminatory animus, or suggesting that she was treated differently than others. See Khaleel v. Metro One Loss Prevention Servs. Groups, 469 F. Supp. 2d 130, 133 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) ("There is no indication that he was replaced by another person not within any protected class he claims, that any such person was treated more favorably, or that there was evidence that other members of any of the protected classes he embraces suffered similar discrimination, so as to suggest that there were circumstances surrounding Metro One's alleged adverse action giving rise to a fair inference of discrimination."). As such, Plaintiff fails to establish the fourth element of a prima facie Title VII discrimination cause of action.
Based on the foregoing reasons, the Court recommends that Defendants' motion be granted as to Blair's Title VII discrimination claim.

ii. ADA
Plaintiff's [*35]  ADA discrimination claim similarly fails to state a plausible cause of action. To state a "prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that: (a) her employer is subject to the ADA; (b) she is disabled within the meaning of the ADA or perceived to be so by her employer; (c) she was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation; and (d) she suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability." Monterroso v. Sullivan & Cromwell, LLP, 591 F. Supp. 2d 567, 577 (S.D.N.Y. 2008).
The definition of an "adverse employment action" is the same under both Title VII and the ADA. See Wanamaker v. Town of Westport Bd. of Educ., 11 F. Supp. 3d 51, 78, n.6 (D. Conn. 2014) ("Courts use the same definition for 'adverse employment actions' in discrimination cases brought under the ADA [and Title VII]."); Noon v. Int'l Bus. Machines, No. 12 CIV. 4544, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174172, 2013 WL 6504410, at *6, n. 4 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 11, 2013) ("Courts use the same definition for 'adverse employment action' in discrimination claims brought under the ADA [and] Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . . . ." ). Therefore, for the same reasons expressed above regarding dismissal of Blair's Title VII claim for lack of an adverse employment action, the ADA claim similarly fails.
Additionally, the Court recommends a finding that Plaintiff's ADA discrimination claim fails as she does not allege that she was "otherwise [*36]  qualified to perform the essential functions of the job." The term "otherwise qualified" has been defined as "able to perform the essential functions of the job, either with or without a reasonable accommodation." See Parisi v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of N.Y., 995 F. Supp. 298, 303 (E.D.N.Y. 1998), aff'd, 172 F.3d 38 (2d Cir. 1999). What constitutes an "essential function" is not defined by the ADA, but is "generally defined in ADA regulations promulgated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [] to mean the 'fundamental' duties to be performed in the position in question, but not functions that are merely 'marginal' . . . ." Stone v. City of Mount Vernon, 118 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 1997) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1) (1996)). Further, "[a]fter the essential functions of the position are determined, the plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she could have performed these functions, with or without reasonable accommodation, at the time of the termination or discipline." McMillan v. City of N.Y., 711 F.3d 120, 127 (2d Cir. 2013). "Reasonable accommodation" is defined by the ADA in a non-exclusive manner as:
(A) making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities; and
(B) job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, [*37]  training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(9). Establishing a reasonable accommodation is not a "heavy" burden, as "[i]t is enough for the plaintiff to suggest the existence of a plausible accommodation, the costs of which, facially, do not clearly exceed its benefits." Borkowski v. Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 63 F.3d 131, 138 (2d Cir. 1995).
Here, Blair contends that during her eight week leave in early 2014 she "was forced to be on unpaid leave due to [Defendants'] inability to position her at another [School] location." Compl. at 16. However, she fails to contend that she was, even with the transfer, "otherwise qualified" to perform the job, with or without reasonable accommodation. Rather, based on the Complaint, at the time Plaintiff was on leave, her doctor had "marked [her] totally disabled" and required her to be completely out of work. Id. at 15. As Blair was fully unable to work at the time she needed the transfer, it cannot be said that she would have been qualified to perform the job even if transferred. See Parisi, 995 F. Supp. at 301 ("Parisi concedes in his complaint that he is unable to perform the essential functions of his job as route deliveryman [] and does not allege [*38]  that any adjustment would permit him to resume his former job. Accordingly, he is not 'otherwise qualified' for that job."). Furthermore, as she was unable to work, she could not perform the job with a reasonable accommodation of a transfer, and, in any event, "an employer is not required to provide disabled employees with alternative employment when the employee is unable to meet the demands of his present position." Christopher v. Laidlaw Transit Inc., 899 F. Supp. 1224, 1227 (S.D.N.Y. 1995).
Accordingly, the Court recommends that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss be granted as to Blair's ADA discrimination cause of action.9
4. Failure to Accommodate
Plaintiff asserts that the School failed to accommodate her disability by refusing to transfer her to another location. To state a claim for failure to accommodate under the ADA, a plaintiff must allege:
(1) plaintiff is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ADA;
(2) an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability; (3) with reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job at issue; and (4) the employer has refused to make such accommodations.
McMillan, 711 F.3d at 125 (quoting Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc., 445 F.3d 161, 169 (2d Cir. 2006)).
The Court need not address the merits of this claim as it is time-barred. "[A]n employer's rejection of an [*39]  employee's request for a reasonable accommodation is a 'discrete act' that triggers the running of the statute of limitations for a failure to accommodate claim." Clark v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co., No. 3:15-CV-00304, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108242, 2016 WL 4408983, at *6 (D. Conn. Aug. 16, 2016). Here, the first request for a reasonable accommodation was made by Blair in late 2012, when she requested that Defendants free the "workplace environment" from "contamination that was causing her disability." See Compl. at 11. Although Plaintiff does not overtly state when this request was denied, she expresses throughout the entirety of her Complaint that Defendants never remedied the toxic environment. The second request was on January 23, 2014, when her doctor "demanded" that she be transferred from the Huntington Station location. Id. at 15. Based on the Complaint it appears as if this request was denied immediately, or at least before Plaintiff's last day on February 17, 2014, prior to her time on leave. See id. ("Despite this reasonable accommodation, Respondent did not offered [sic] Charging Party anything and was placed back at Respondent's same unsafe location."). As these dates all occurred prior to February 23, 2014, they are barred by the statute of limitations. [*40]  See Elmenayer v. ABF Freight Sys., Inc., 318 F.3d 130, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2003) ("[A]n employer's rejection of an employee's proposed accommodation . . . does not give rise to a continuing violation. Rather, the rejection is the sort of 'discrete act' that must be the subject of a complaint to the EEOC within 300 days.").
Accordingly, the Court recommends that Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim be dismissed as to the moving Defendants.
5. Retaliation
Blair's retaliation claim is similarly untenable. To state a prima facie retaliation claim under Title VII and the ADA, a plaintiff must show that: "(1) she was engaged in protected activity; (2) the employer was aware of that activity; (3) the employee suffered a materially adverse action; and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and that adverse action." Harper v. Brooklyn Children's Ctr., No. 12-CV-4545, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37649, 2014 WL 1154056, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 20, 2014) (quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original); Reynolds v. Gallagher Bassett Serv., Inc., No. 5:13-CV-1475, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134161, 2014 WL 4771866, at *10 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2014) ("Courts evaluate retaliation claims using the same framework, whether the claims are brought under Title VII or the ADA."). To survive a motion to dismiss, "the plaintiff must plausibly allege that: (1) defendants discriminated—or took an adverse employment action—against him, (2) 'because' he has opposed any unlawful employment [*41]  practice. Vega v. Hempstead Union Free Sch. Dist., 801 F.3d 72, 90 (2d Cir. 2015).
In the retaliation context, Courts have found an action "materially adverse" where "it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination." See Harper, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37649, 2014 WL 1154056, at *3 (quoting Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006)). It is "broader than that which is applied under the substantive antidiscrimination provision of Title VII, and extends beyond workplace-related or employment-related retaliatory acts and harm." Donohue v. Finkelstein Mem'l Library, 987 F. Supp. 2d 415, 427 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, "a plaintiff must plausibly plead a connection between the act and his engagement in protected activity." Vega, 801 F.3d at 90. "A causal connection in retaliation claims can be shown either '(1) indirectly, by showing that the protected activity was followed closely by discriminatory treatment, or through other circumstantial evidence such as disparate treatment of fellow employees who engaged in similar conduct; or (2) directly, through evidence of retaliatory animus directed against the plaintiff by the defendant.' " Littlejohn, 795 F.3d at 319 (quoting Gordon v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., 232 F.3d 111, 117 (2d Cir.2000)).
The Court finds Blair's allegations insufficient to support a retaliation cause of action because she fails to allege a timely material adverse employment action. Specifically, she alleges that: she was not sent disability forms [*42]  "[d]emonstrating further retaliation and discrimination based on Charging Party's Gender and disability;" (2) she was threatened termination, other "adverse actions," and denied health insurance "in direct retaliation of Charging Party's disability and reasonable accommodation requests"; and (3) she faced "[m]ore retaliation" when she informed Defendants that she was spending time with her son in the hospital. See Compl. at 15-16. At the outset, her contention that she faced "more retaliation" when informing the School that she was spending time with her son is too vague to establish an adverse action. Also, despite the broader definition of adverse employment action for a retaliation claim, neither a threat of termination or denial of health benefits on its own, without further allegations establishing her right to those benefits, constitute an adverse employment action sufficient to support a claim. See Spaulding v. N.Y. City Dep't of Educ., No. 12CIV3041, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127076, 2015 WL 12645530, at *44 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 19, 2015), (Report and Recommendation), adopted by 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126292, 2015 WL 5560286 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2015) (finding no adverse action for retaliation purposes where "Plaintiff has not demonstrated that she was entitled to health benefits after she failed to return to work . . . ."); Turley v. ISG Lackawanna, Inc., 803 F. Supp. 2d 217, 254 (W.D.N.Y. 2011) ("Furthermore, threats of termination [*43]  or other punishment do not qualify as adverse actions where they were never carried through.").
Accordingly, the Court recommends that the retaliation claim also be dismissed.
6. Hostile Work Environment
Plaintiff complains that she was "intimidated," "threatened," and the subject of "hostile comments" in early 2014, which the Court construes as a hostile work environment claim. See Compl. at 13-15. Unlike discrimination and retaliation claims, a plaintiff need not show an adverse employment action to establish a hostile work environment claim. Rather, to state this cause of action under Title VII and the ADA, a "plaintiff must plead facts that would tend to show that the complained of conduct: (1) is objectively severe or pervasive—that is, creates an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive; (2) creates an environment that the plaintiff subjectively perceives as hostile or abusive; and (3) creates such an environment because of the plaintiff's [protected class]." Patane v. Clark, 508 F.3d 106, 113 (2d Cir. 2007) (quotation marks and alterations omitted); see Gomez v. N.Y. City Police Dep't, 191 F. Supp. 3d 293, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74196, 2016 WL 3212108, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) ("Hostile work environment claims under the ADA [] are evaluated under the same standards as hostile work environment claims under Title VII . . . .") [*44]  (internal quotation marks omitted).10 Moreover, a court should focus on the "totality of the circumstances" in analyzing a hostile work environment claim, including " 'the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with the victim's [job] performance.' " Rivera v. Rochester Genesee Reg'l Transp. Auth., 743 F.3d 11, 20 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Hayut v. State Univ. of N.Y., 352 F.3d 733, 745 (2d Cir. 2003)).
Applying these standards, the Court recommends that this claim be dismissed for failure to plead that the alleged hostile environment was created on account of Blair's gender and disability. Although Plaintiff pleads that Lacey and Cornell made rude and aggressive comments to her, including telling her to "keep her mouth shut," she does not connect any of these statements to her gender or disability. The only allegations connected at most to Blair's membership in a protected class is at the end of her Complaint—that "Respondent" stated "Let's get rid of the pregnant woman before this gets worst [sic]," but does not explain who made the statement, when it was said, or in what context. See Compl. at 16-17. Accordingly, this unattributed statement is nothing more than a non-actionable stray [*45]  remark. See Rivera v. Brooklyn Hosp. Med. Ctr., 28 F. Supp. 3d 159, 163 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) ("There is only one remark that referenced his ethnic origin in the entirety of his hostile work environment allegations; that is the classic 'stray remark' which, standing alone, will not support a discrimination or hostile work environment claim."). Accordingly, Plaintiff fails to state a claim for hostile work environment under Title VII or the ADA, and thus the Court recommends that this cause of action be dismissed as to the moving Defendants. See Richards v. N.Y. City Dep't of Educ., No. 13-CV-16, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89949, 2015 WL 4164746, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. July 10, 2015) ("Even if Richards had demonstrated that her work environment was hostile—and she has not—Title VII, the ADA, and the NYSHRL require evidence to support the inference that plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment because of her membership in a protected class."); Ventimiglia v. Hustedt Chevrolet, No. CIV.A. 05-4149, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24834, 2009 WL 803477, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 25, 2009) ("Finally, it is axiomatic that in order to establish a hostile work environment under Title VII, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the conduct occurred because of his membership in a protected class.").

C. State Law Claims
Finally, the Court turns to Blair's state law claims brought pursuant to the NYSHRL, which have gone unaddressed by Defendants. Having determined that Plaintiff's federal law claims fail to allege a cause of action, and as she does [*46]  not plead diversity of citizenship, the Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over these claims. See Cave v. E. Meadow Union Free Sch. Dist., 514 F.3d 240, 250 (2d Cir. 2008) ("It would thus be clearly inappropriate for the district court to retain jurisdiction over the state law claims when there is no basis for supplemental jurisdiction."); Kolari v. N.Y.-Presbyterian Hosp., 455 F.3d 118, 122 (2d Cir. 2006) ("Of particular relevance here, a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction if it has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.") (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, "[i]n the interest of comity, the Second Circuit instructs that 'absent exceptional circumstances,' where federal claims can be disposed of pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) or summary judgment grounds, courts should 'abstain from exercising pendent jurisdiction.' " Birch v. Pioneer Credit Recovery, Inc., No. 06-CV-6497, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41834, 2007 WL 1703914, at *5 (W.D.N.Y. June 8, 2007), aff'd sub nom. Burch v. Pioneer Credit Recovery, Inc., 551 F.3d 122 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting Walker v. Time Life Films, Inc., 784 F.2d 44, 53 (2d Cir.1986), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106 S. Ct. 2278, 90 L. Ed. 2d 721 (1986)). Accordingly, the Court recommends that the state law claims also be dismissed.

IV. Leave to Amend
Pursuant to Rule 15, the Court may grant leave to amend "when justice so requires." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Further, if "dismissal is based on a pro se plaintiff's failure to comply with pleading conventions, a district court should not dismiss without granting leave to amend at least once when a liberal reading of the complaint gives [*47]  any indication that a valid claim might be stated." Henriquez-Ford v. Council of Sch. Supervisors & Administrators, No. 14-CV-2496, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1681, 2016 WL 93863, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 7, 2016) (quoting Crisci-Balestra v. Civil Serv. Employees Ass'n, Inc., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10870, 2008 WL 413812, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 13, 2008)). A pro se litigant should be given one opportunity to amend "unless the court can rule out any possibility, however unlikely it might be, that an amended complaint would succeed in stating a claim." Vlad-Berindan v. MTA New York City Transit, No. 14-CV-675, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171289, 2014 WL 6982929, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 10, 2014) (quoting Gomez v. USAA Federal Savings Bank, 171 F.3d 794, 796 (2d Cir. 1999) (per curiam)). Here, Defendants argue that permission to amend should not be granted where, as it purports exists here, "Plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of her claim that would entitle her to relief." Def.'s Mem. Law at 4. Although agreeing with the legal principle, the Court is not persuaded that amendment would be futile. As such, the Court recommends that, in the event Judge Bianco adopts this Report and Recommendation, Blair be granted 30 days leave to amend the Complaint regarding both her federal and state law claims.

V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, the Court recommends that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss be granted in its entirety, but that Blair be given leave to amend the Complaint.
