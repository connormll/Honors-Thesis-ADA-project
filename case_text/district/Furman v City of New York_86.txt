Opinion



AMENDED REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
JAMES ORENSTEIN, Magistrate Judge:
Plaintiff John Furman ("Furman"), a supervisory custodial engineer in the New York City public school system, filed this action against the City of New York and its Department of Education ("DOE" or, collectively with The City of New York, the "City"), alleging that they discriminated against him based on his disability and his age and created a hostile work environment, in violation of federal and state law. See Docket [*2]  Entry ("DE") 7 (Amended Verified Complaint) ("Complaint"). After the close of discovery, Furman withdrew his claims of age discrimination, DE 29, and on December 8, 2008, the City moved for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 on the remaining disability-based claims. DE 34. On March 24, 2009, the Honorable Roslynn R. Mauskopf, United States District Judge, referred the matter to me for a report and recommendation. I now make my report and, for the reasons set forth below, respectfully recommend that the court grant the motion in part and deny it in part. Specifically, because there are genuinely disputed issues of material fact as to whether the City took an adverse employment action against Furman on the basis of his disability, I recommend that the court deny that portion of the motion and allow such claims to go to trial; however, I also recommend that the court dismiss Furman's hostile work environment claim.
I. Background
A. Factual Background
In reviewing the record for purposes of assessing the City's motion for summary judgment, I construe the evidence in the light most favorable to Furman, draw all reasonable inferences in his favor, and eschew any attempt to determine credibility. [*3]  See, e.g., Vazquez v. Southside United Hous. Dev. Fund Corp., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74480, 2009 WL 2596490, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2009) (quoting Wevant v. Okst, 101 F.3d 845, 854 (2d Cir. 1996)). I provide a summary of the relevant facts as to which the parties generally agree without citation to the record (but noting the evidence as to certain areas of disagreement).1
Plaintiff Furman has been employed by the DOE since June 2001, and at all relevant times worked as a supervisory custodial engineer. In June 2003, Furman was injured while working at Public School ("P.S.") 46 in Bayside, New York. As a result of his injury, Furman was absent [*4]  from work on fully paid sick leave from June 27 through November 17, 2003. Following his return to work in November 2003, Furman was intermittently absent until the following May, when he was once again absent for a lengthy period — from May 14, 2004 through January 11, 2005. Following a June 3, 2004, memorandum requiring Furman to substantiate future sick leave with a physician's certificate, for subsequent absences Furman obtained a note from his doctor stating that he was not to return to work until a specified date.
Furman returned to work on January 11, 2005, but was absent several more times in 2005: from May 6 until June 3, from September 23 through October 10, and again from November 4 until December 23, at which time his doctor authorized him to return to work. Notwithstanding the doctor's authorization to return to work on December 23, 2005, Furman remained unable to perform his duties through December 29, 2005. On December 30, 2005, the DOE removed Furman from its payroll and placed him on workers' compensation leave. In September 2007, Furman returned to work and was reassigned to P.S. 284.
The DOE arranged to have physicians that it engaged examine Furman on several occasions; [*5]  and those physicians generally reached conclusions that did not match the opinion of Furman's own doctor that he was unable to work. After the first such examination, on August 4, 2004, the DOE's doctor found Furman "fit" for duty. Klepfish Dec. Ex. J. The DOE doctor performing the second such examination, on September 21, 2004, concluded that Furman had a "moderate partial disability" and was "unable to return to work as a custodial engineer at [that] time." Klepfish Dec. Ex. N. After still another examination, a DOE physician reported on December 8, 2005, that there were "no objective findings to preclude [Furman's] return to work." Klepfish Dec. Ex. EE.
It is clear that Furman's absences did not sit well with his superiors. What is less clear, but of critical importance to the disposition of this motion, is the extent to which the DOE threatened and eventually took action against Furman due to the nature of his disability, as distinct from the effect of that disability on Furman's ability to work. In a memorandum dated June 3, 2004, supervisor Anthony Ingorgia ("Ingorgia") informed Furman that because he had used 22 1/2 sick days he must provide a certificate from his physician to [*6]  document any further medical absences.2 In a letter dated October 21, 2004, Ingorgia informed Furman that because he was unable to provide a date on which he would return to work, he would be removed from the DOE's active payroll as of the close of business on January 11, 2005.3 Ingorgia wrote Furman another memorandum on December 17, 2004, in which he stated that a conference would be held to discuss Furman's alleged failure to submit time sheets and a doctor's note indicating when he would return to work. It is unclear from the record whether this conference was ever held, because as already noted, Furman returned to work on January 11, 2005. During Furman's absence from work during the latter months of 2005, Ingorgia again admonished Furman that he had been "excessively absent" and that he was "violating the established procedure when reporting absences." Klepfish Dec. Ex. AA.
As the DOE's impatience with Furman continued, its willingness to accept Furman's return to work diminished. In a letter dated November 29, 2005, DOE Deputy Regional Facilities Manager Lawrence Johnson repeated Ingorgia's earlier criticism and prohibited Furman from even entering the building in which he [*7]  worked "unless you [Furman] present this office with a doctor's note which allows you to return to full, unrestricted 100% limitation free duty." Klepfish Dec. Ex. BB (emphasis added). A few weeks later, on December 22, 2005, DOE Director of Labor Relations Michelle Jung ("Jung") wrote a similar letter citing a physician's report that Furman's "injuries are permanent and will never improve" and going on to state that "[i]n light of your medical condition . . . you shall be removed from active payroll[.]" Klepfish Dec. Ex. FF (emphasis added).
The evidence establishes that Furman obtained a note from his doctor the next day, stating that Furman "may return to work as of today 12/23/05[.]" Klepfish Dec. Ex. GG. At a meeting with Jung three days later, on December 28, 2005, Furman stated that although his injuries are permanent, he was taking steps "which would enable him to go to work." Klepfish Dec. Ex. HH. That did not satisfy Jung; instead, she told Furman that "he must submit a physician's note stating that he is fully recovered" and further required that the physician certify that Furman "does not suffer from any permanent debilitating injury." Id. (emphasis added); see also Furman [*8]  Dep. at 129-30.
The parties disagree to some extent as to whether Furman requested a reasonable accommodation for a disability. The City, citing Furman's deposition testimony, asserts that Furman "never requested a reasonable accommodation." Statement ¶ 63. As Furman responds, and his testimony makes clear, he did in fact orally request an accommodation by asking Ingorgia whether he might be able to work "some half days" and "get some therapy." Furman Dep. at 115-116. The City replies by replacing its initial assertion that Furman "never requested" a reasonable accommodation with the more modest observation that Furman "does not cite to any admissible evidence that he properly requested a reasonable accommodation in accordance with DOE Personnel Memorandum No. 51[.]" Response ¶ 6 (emphasis added). I discuss below the significance of this disagreement to the viability of Furman's discrimination claim.
B. Procedural History
Furman filed his initial complaint on March 9, 2007, DE 1, and amended his pleading on June 25, 2007. DE 7. He initially asserted four claims against the City: age discrimination under federal and state law (Counts I and II, respectively, Complaint ¶¶ 46-61); and discrimination [*9]  on the basis of his disability under both the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (the "ADA"), and the corresponding law of New York State (Counts III and IV, respectively, Complaint ¶¶ 62-75). In addition to asserting discriminatory treatment on the basis of age and disability, Furman also included allegations in three of the four claims — both age discrimination claims and the disability claim under state law, but not the ADA claim — that he was subjected to a hostile work environment. See Complaint ¶¶ 49, 57, 71. The parties conducted full discovery in the following year, and the City filed the instant motion for summary judgment on December 8, 2008. Several months later, the court referred the motion to me for a report and recommendation. Order dated March 24, 2009.
II. Discussion
A. Summary Judgment
"Under Rule 56(c), summary judgment is proper 'if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.'" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). In determining whether to grant summary judgment, a court is confined to issue-finding, [*10]  not issue resolution. Rasmussen v. Sigma Corp. of Am., 27 F. Supp. 2d 388, 391 (E.D.N.Y. 1998) (citations omitted). The court does not "weigh the evidence and resolve . . . factual issues" but rather "determine[s] as a threshold matter whether there are genuine unresolved issues of material fact to be tried." Owens v. New York City Hous. Auth., 934 F.2d 405, 408 (2d Cir. 1991) (quoting Gibson v. Am. Broadcasting Cos., 892 F.2d 1128, 1132 (2d Cir. 1989)); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). A fact is material if it "'might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.'" Holtz v. Rockefeller & Co., 258 F.3d 62, 69 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). A genuine issue is presented if "'the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non[-]moving party.'" Id. In assessing the evidence, "all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the non-movant[.]" Wellesley v. Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, 346 Fed. Appx. 662, 2009 WL 3004102, at *1 (2d Cir. 2009). A party opposing summary judgment may not rely solely on allegations in the complaint to establish a genuine issue of material fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Graham v. Lewinski, 848 F.2d 342, 344 (2d Cir. 1988). Moreover, pursuant to this court's local rules, the non-moving party must explicitly state the specific material facts as to which it contends there is or is not a genuine issue to be tried, and must support each such specification with a citation to admissible evidence in the record. Loc. Civ. R. 56.1.
In evaluating an employer's motion for summary judgment in the context of an employment discrimination action, courts must be "particularly cautious" in light of the difficulty of [*11]  locating direct evidence of the employer's discriminatory intent, and the need to evaluate circumstantial proof of its intentions. Schwapp v. Town of Avon, 118 F.3d 106, 110 (2d Cir. 1997). Nevertheless, a plaintiff cannot defeat summary judgment in this context by presenting only conclusory allegations; more is required. Id. "Although intermediate evidentiary burdens shift back and forth under this framework, '[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.'" Ragusa v. Malverne Union Free School Dist., 582 F. Supp. 2d 326, 339 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (quoting Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000)).
B. The Discrimination Claims
Claims of discrimination under both the ADA and New York State's Human Rights Law are governed by the burden-shifting framework established by McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Rambacher v. Bemus Point Cent. Sch. Dist., 307 Fed. Appx. 541, 543 (2d Cir. 2009) (citing McDonnell Douglas); Sista v. CDC Ixis North Am., Inc., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2163, 2005 WL 356973, at *6 n.7 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 15, 2005) (applying same analysis to state law discrimination claims). The plaintiff must first produce some evidence to show each of the elements of a prima facie claim of discrimination. Rambacher, 307 Fed. Appx. at 543 (citing Patterson v. County of Oneida, 375 F.3d 206, 221 (2d Cir. 2004)). The defendant then has the burden of coming forward with admissible evidence to demonstrate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action. Id. The plaintiff must then prove, by competent evidence, that the stated reason was pretextual, and that the action was in [*12]  fact motivated by a discriminatory intent. Id.
In order to establish an employment discrimination claim under the ADA, Furman must demonstrate that his employer is subject to the ADA; that he was a person with a disability within the meaning of the ADA; that he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and that he suffered adverse employment action because of his disability. Shannon v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., 332 F.3d 95, 99 (2d Cir. 2003). The City appears to accept that Furman can establish the first two elements. Its request for summary judgment focuses instead on two fundamental issues: first, whether Furman has adduced sufficient evidence to support a finding that the City took action against him on the basis of his disability; and second, whether Furman properly asked for, and was improperly denied, a reasonable accommodation of his disability. The latter dispute, in turn, raises three subsidiary issues: whether Furman was capable of performing his job functions regardless of any accommodation; whether Furman took sufficient steps to request such accommodation as he might need; and whether the accommodation that Furman proposed was reasonable.
1. Evidence Of Discrimination [*13] 
The City argues that Furman cannot establish the elements of a prima facie claim of discrimination under the ADA. Specifically, it contends that Furman cannot show that the adverse employment action about which he complains occurred "under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination." Memo. at 6. In support of that argument, the City points to Furman's repeated and lengthy absences from work, and to the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement ("CBA") governing relations between the DOE and the union of which Furman was a member. See Memo. at 6-8. The CBA makes clear that when a custodian engineer is unable to perform his duties due to an injury, a temporary replacement may be utilized for at least 30 days, and may be extended to 90 days at the discretion of the Deputy Director of Plant Operation Services. Klepfish Dec. Ex. OO (CBA). An additional, further period of temporary care may be authorized based on the employee's length of service, prior sick absences, and the needs of the school. Id. Relying on the CBA, the City argues that, having granted Furman a discretionary additional 90-day absence, the DOE was under no further obligation to continue his leave indefinitely. Memo. at 8.
In making [*14]  this argument, the City relies heavily on the fact that Furman's supervisors demanded, but never received, "a doctor's note indicating that [he was] 100% fit to return to work and that [he] did not suffer from a permanent injury." Memo. at 8. The City apparently views that fact as a reason it should prevail. I do not; to the contrary, it is the DOE's insistence that Furman prove himself to be "100% fit" as a condition for remaining on its payroll that precludes summary judgment.
A policy that requires an employee to be 100 percent healed prior to returning to work violates the ADA. Warmsley v. New York City Transit Authority, 308 F. Supp. 2d 114, 122 (E.D.N.Y. 2004) (collecting cases); EEOC v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16826, 2002 WL 31011859, at *20 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2002) ("Courts have consistently found that policies prohibiting injured employees from returning to work unless they can do so 'without restrictions' violate the ADA."). A requirement that an employee return to work only when he is fully healed "discriminates against qualified individuals with disabilities because such a policy permits employers to substitute a determination of whether a qualified individual is '100% healed' from their injury for the required individual assessment whether the qualified individual is able to perform the essential functions of his or her job either with or without accommodation." [*15]  Id. (citing McGregor v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 187 F.3d 1113, 1116 (9th Cir. 1999)).
There appears to be no dispute that the DOE required Furman to be 100 percent healed before it permitted him to return to his position — indeed, the City unabashedly trumpets its imposition of the "100 % fit" requirement in its statement of undisputed facts. Statement ¶¶ 51, 61. Specifically, the parties agree that Furman was informed by letter on December 22, 2005 that he was being removed from active payroll, id. ¶ 50, and that he was further advised that in order to return to work he would need to "produce a physician's note indicating that [he was] 100% fit to return to work and that [he] did not suffer from a permanent injury." Id. ¶ 51; Furman Dep. at 129-30. At a meeting on December 28, 2005 memorialized in a memorandum written by Michelle Jung, Furman was once more informed that he was required to produce a note from his doctor that "specifically indicate[d]" that he was 100 percent fit to return to his prior position. Klepfish Dec. Ex. HH. Although the defendants argue that these actions were taken "because of [Furman's] excessive use of sick leave," Memo. at 8, they point to no evidence that the DOE conducted an individualized assessment of Furman's condition and his ability [*16]  to return to his prior position, with or without an accommodation.4
I recognize that there may be some semantic daylight between the "100% fit" phrase that the DOE used in its communications with Furman and the requirement of "100% healed" that the cited case law prohibits as a violation of the ADA. A person who has not fully recovered from an injury may nevertheless be completely "fit" to perform the duties of his employment. Such semantic distinctions are inapposite here. On the City's motion for summary judgment, the court must draw all available inferences in Furman's favor. Viewing the record in context, it is at least an available inference — and in my view the overwhelmingly natural reading — that in requiring Furman to prove he was "100% fit," the DOE was in fact requiring Furman to prove that his injuries had completely healed, in violation of the ADA. Indeed, even after Furman obtained a doctor's unconditional authorization to return to work immediately, and even after Furman advised Jung of the steps he was taking to ensure his ability to work despite having a permanent injury, Jung insisted as a condition of Furman's continued employment on the active payroll that he [*17]  provide proof that he was "fully recovered[.]" Klepfish Dec. Ex. HH. It is therefore clear that Furman suffered an adverse employment action — removal from active payroll — because of his disability, and I conclude that he has established a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA.
Furman having established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendants to proffer evidence of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his removal from payroll. See Rambacher, 307 Fed. Appx. at 543. The defendants argue that Furman was dismissed because he was unable to work for extended periods of time, had exhausted the leave permitted under the terms of the CBA, and could not name a date on which he would be able to return to work. Memo. at 10. Here again, the City relies on evidence that undermines, rather than supports, its position. Taking action against Furman because he had not submitted a prediction from his physician as to "when [he] would be healed[,]" id., may strike the City as being legitimate, but the law of this jurisdiction plainly prohibits it as discriminatory. See Warmsley, 308 F. Supp. 2d at 122. Thus, for the same reason that Furman has succeeded in adducing sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case, the City has failed to identify [*18]  a wholly legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for removing Furman from the DOE payroll.
Moreover, even if Furman's poor history of appearing for work or adequately justifying his absences constituted a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action at issue — in other words, if the DOE's insistence on proof that Furman was "100% fit" could be ignored and the remainder of its explanation accepted for purposes of the second step of the McDonnell Douglas inquiry — there would nevertheless be a triable issue of fact as to whether that explanation was pretextual. As Furman notes, his doctor authorized him to return to work, effective immediately, on December 23, 2005 - just six days before the DOE removed Furman from its payroll. Opp. at 9; see Klepfish Dec. Ex. GG. If a jury credits that evidence, it could reasonably conclude that at the time the DOE removed Furman from its payroll, it knew that Furman was able to perform his job but nevertheless insisted on proof that he did not suffer from a disability — and that conclusion would support a finding of prohibited discrimination. I therefore conclude that the record does not permit the court to dismiss Furman's claims [*19]  on the ground that there is insufficient evidence of discriminatory intent.
2. Reasonable Accommodation
In addition to prohibiting an employer from imposing an adverse employment action on an employee on the basis of a disability, the ADA also subjects an employer to liability for failing to make reasonable accommodations to an employee's known physical limitations, unless such accommodations would impose an undue hardship on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5). To state a claim for failure to accommodate under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that he is a person with a disability within the meaning of the ADA; that his employer was covered by the statute and had notice of his disability; that with reasonable accommodation he could perform the essential functions of the job at issue; and that the employer has refused to make such accommodations. Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., 457 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Rodal v. Anesthesia Group of Onondaga, P.C., 369 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir. 2004)).
a. Furman's Ability To Perform His Duties
The defendants argue that Furman was unable to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without accommodation. They point out that, at the time of his removal from payroll, Furman was unable to work due to his injuries, and that his disability was confirmed by a private physician following his removal from [*20]  payroll. Memo. at 13; Klepfish Dec. Ex. JJ. Moreover, they argue that on his application for Social Security disability benefits, Furman stated that he was disabled. Id., Klepfish Dec. Ex. LL, at 1 (stating Furman was unable to work due to injury as of September 23, 2005).
With regard to the latter point, the Supreme Court has held that the "pursuit, and receipt, of [Social Security disability] benefits does not automatically estop the recipient from pursuing an ADA claim." Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 797, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999) (cited in Opp. at 9 n.1). Although an irreconcilable contradiction between statements made on an application for Social Security benefits and those made in a subsequent ADA claim will prevent a plaintiff from prevailing in the latter proceeding, the plaintiff can survive a motion for summary judgment if he can explain the discrepancy. Id. at 807. "To defeat summary judgment, that explanation must be sufficient to warrant a reasonable juror's concluding that, assuming the truth of, or the plaintiff's good-faith belief in, the earlier statement, the plaintiff could nonetheless perform the 'essential functions' of her job, with or without 'reasonable accommodation.'" Id., see also Bohen v. Potter, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23717, 2009 WL 791356, at *9 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 23, 2009) (quoting Nodelman v. Gruner & Jahr USA Pub., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5398, 2000 WL 502858, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 26, 2000).
Although Furman has made little effort to explain the discrepancy [*21]  between his application for Social Security disability benefits and his current claim that he could have continued to work had he been afforded a reasonable accommodation, I conclude that the two statements are not irreconcilable. Furman's statements in support of his application for disability benefits were made "in a forum which does not consider the effect that reasonable workplace accommodations would have on the ability to work." See Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 807. It is for precisely that reason that the Court in Cleveland "ruled that a representation of complete disability in a Social Security proceeding was not directly contradicted by the same person's ADA claim that he could perform essential job functions with reasonable accommodation[.]" Rodal, 369 F.3d at 119. Because Furman argues that he could have performed his job given appropriate accommodation, his statements to the Social Security Administration do not estop his present claim. See Abbate v. Cendant Mobility Servs. Corp., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50623, 2007 WL 2021868, at *6 (D. Conn. July 13, 2007); Nodelman, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5398, 2000 WL 502858, at *8. Moreover, Furman applied for Social Security disability benefits only after the DOE had, in his view at least, denied him a reasonable accommodation that would have permitted him to continue working and had instead removed him from the payroll. Compare Statement ¶ 55 (noting date of [*22]  Furman's removal from the DOE's active payroll as December 30, 2005) with Klepfish Dec. Ex. LL, at 5 (Social Security disability application dated October 7, 2006).
I therefore conclude, contrary to the City's position, that Furman is not estopped from asserting that he was able to perform his job functions with a reasonable accommodation. Absent such estoppel, it is clear that the parties have a genuine dispute of fact on that material issue because there is evidence both that Furman's doctor authorized him to return to work and that Furman had identified potential accommodations that might allow him to fulfill his duties when he inquired of Ingorgia about a work schedule including "some half days" and "some therapy."5 Furman Dep. at 116. Regardless of whether the latter inquiry was made in a sufficiently formal way to trigger any responsive obligation on the part of the DOE — an issue I address below — it at least suffices to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether Furman could succeed at his job if given a reasonable accommodation for his inquiry. See, e.g., Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 338 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding that an employer's decision to terminate a disabled employee who can perform the essential functions of his job [*23]  but who has been denied a reasonable accommodation constitutes unlawful discrimination under the ADA; citing Borkowski v. Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 63 F.3d 131, 143 (2d Cir. 1995)).
b. The Sufficiency Of Furman's Request For Accommodation
In seeking summary judgment on the failure-to-accommodate claim, the City first submits a carefully worded denial that Furman requested an accommodation at certain times, and then, in the face of Furman's assertion that he did indeed request an accommodation, points to the fact that Furman did not make the request in the manner that the DOE prefers. Compare Statement ¶ 63 (stating that "[d]uring all the periods of time plaintiff was out of work he never requested a reasonable accommodation") with Counter-Statement ¶ 63 (disputing defendants' Rule 56.1 statement and citing to Furman Tr.); with Response ¶ 6 (Furman "does not cite to any admissible evidence that he properly requested a reasonable accommodation in accordance with DOE Personnel Memorandum No. 51[.]"); see also Furman Dep. at 115-16 (testifying that Furman did not submit a written request for an accommodation, and further testifying that he made an oral request for one to Ingorgia in December 2005); Memo. at 14 (arguing that "[w]hile plaintiff claims his oral requests [*24]  for accommodations were denied, he concedes he did not follow any of DOE's protocols to formally request any reasonable accommodation").
The record thus sufficiently establishes that Furman made some kind of request. But that does not mean he made a legally cognizable request that would make the facts on which he relies material. The court must therefore assess the legal significance of Furman's oral request and of the DOE's insistence on a formal written request.
The City faults Furman for his undisputed failure to file a formal request for accommodation pursuant to DOE Personnel Memorandum No. 51, which provides as follows:
As a first step, an individual who feels that he/she is in need of an accommodation should first discuss the request with the school, district or office administrator. No accommodation request will be reviewed by the Medical Bureau without this request first being brought to the attention of the local school, district, or office administration. . . . If an accommodation cannot be provided through informal means at the local school, district or office level or if the employee does not wish to discuss his/her disability with school, district or office personnel, the [*25]  employee has the right to formally apply for an accommodation through the Medical Bureau by completing the attached Accommodation Request Form and attaching medical documentation to support the request.
Klepfish Dec. Ex. KK.
The record is clear that Furman took the "first step" required under the Memorandum by speaking with Ingorgia and asking whether he could come in "on some half days . . . and get some therapy." Furman Dep. at 116. Ingorgia denied Furman's request. Id. The City contends that Furman's failure to pursue the matter further by filing a written request for accommodation is fatal to his claim. See Memo. at 14.6
I disagree. At a minimum, the City's theory founders on the lack of any evidence to suggest that Furman had reason to know about the DOE's policy for lodging accommodation requests. Certainly there is no evidence that Furman received or was otherwise made aware of the contents of DOE Memorandum No. 51, and Furman affirmatively alleges that he was unaware of any written policy concerning requests for accommodation. See Furman Aff. ¶ 16; Furman Dep. at 99 (Furman's testimony that he did not make a request for accommodation in writing because "everything [*26]  [he] asked for was denied," and going on to state that he did not know "whether it is a procedure of the Department of Education for you to request a reasonable accommodation"). Furman had no obligation to press a request for accommodation that he reasonably perceived to be futile, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that he should have interpreted Ingorgia's refusal of his request as anything other than final.
Moreover, I disagree that the onus was exclusively on Furman to make sure his request for accommodation was made in any particular way. The federal regulations implementing the ADA contemplate an "informal, interactive process" by which the employer and employee identify "the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). Once an employee has informed his employer of the need for accommodation, both parties are obliged to work together to fashion a reasonable accommodation. See Schroeder v. Suffolk County Cmty. College, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52533, 2009 WL 1748869, *14 (E.D.N.Y. June 22, 2009).
It is of course true that an "employee who is responsible for the breakdown of [the] interactive process may not recover for a failure to accommodate." Nugent v. St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hosp. Ctr., 303 Fed. Appx. 943, 946 (2d Cir. 2008). If a jury concludes that Furman had reason to know of [*27]  the DOE's procedure for submitting written accommodation requests, it could easily conclude that he unreasonably failed to follow it and that he is therefore responsible for the breakdown of the interactive process and ineligible for relief. But the record as it currently exists does not remotely establish the facts necessary to dismiss Furman's claim on that basis.
On the other hand, the record does contain evidence from which a jury could reasonably find that Furman did his best to request an accommodation and that the DOE — through Furman's supervisor Ingorgia — refused to consider it. Because an employer may not obstruct the interactive process by refusing to investigate a request and determine its feasibility, such a view of the evidence would establish liability. Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., 457 F.3d 181, 185 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 338 (2d Cir. 2000)).7
c. The Reasonableness Of The Proposed Accommodation
Even if there is sufficient evidence for a jury to find that Furman was capable of performing his job duties with an accommodation and that he requested such help, the City is entitled to summary judgment if there is no way for Furman to prove that it was reasonable for the DOE to provide the kind of accommodation he required. Specifically, Furman must be [*28]  in a position to demonstrate that an accommodation existed that would have allowed him to perform his job's essential functions. Asztalos v. Bryant & Stratton Bus. Inst., Inc., 14 Fed. Appx. 37, 38 (2d Cir. 2001) (citing Borkowski, 63 F.3d at 137-38); see also US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 401-02, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002). If he is, then the City would have the burden of showing that the proposed accommodation would have been unreasonable or would cause the DOE to suffer an undue hardship. Jackan v. New York State Dept. of Labor, 205 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir. 2000) (citing Borkowski, 63 F.3d at 138).
Resolution of that issue on summary judgment is inappropriate because the record shows that the parties have a genuine factual dispute as to the essential functions of Furman's job. The City contends that Furman's job involved "numerous physical activities, including lifting, pushing, and pulling. Statement ¶ 3 (citing Klepfish Exs. B, H, and W).8 Furman disputes this assertion and contends that he was responsible for the maintenance and cleanliness of the school building, that he "had people working for him," that his duties were to "supervise, make schedules, planning, budgets, and minor repairs[,]" and that "[h]e only sometimes had to do physical work." Counter-Statement ¶ 3 (citing Furman Aff. ¶¶ 4, 24; Furman Dep. at 39). This factual dispute is material: without knowing the precise contours of Furman's duties, the court cannot foreclose the possibility [*29]  that the accommodation Furman proposed — being permitted to work part time on some days and to obtain some physical therapy — would allow him to perform the essential functions of his position. As a result, I respectfully recommend that the court decline to dismiss the failure-to-accommodate claims.
d. McBride
Five days after I filed the original version of this Report and Recommendation, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued its decision in McBride v. Bic Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., 583 F.3d 92, 2009 WL 3163218 (2d Cir. 2009). In its opinion, the court held that in the absence of evidence that the plaintiff "was qualified for either her pre-disability position or a suitable vacant position to which she could have been reassigned . . . . an employer's failure to engage in an interactive process intended to discover an accommodation suitable to both parties is immaterial." Id. at *1. In explaining that holding, the court wrote that it was fully in accord with its prior decision in Brady, upon which I partially rely in the discussion above, see pp. 19-20 n.7, supra, for the following reason:
The Brady Court concluded in pertinent part that, under certain circumstances, an employer is required to act proactively to accommodate the disability of [*30]  an employee even if the employee does not request accommodation. See 531 F.3d at 135. In the course of its analysis, it admittedly indicated that, in the absence of a request for specific accommodation, an employer should engage in an interactive process to discover an accommodation workable to both parties and that the defendant employer's failure to do so was sufficient, under the circumstances of that case, to support a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on a failure-to-accommodate claim. See id. at 135-36. Moreover, it noted, but did not further discuss, the defendant employer's contention that the plaintiff had failed to "demonstrate the existence of an accommodation that would have enabled him to perform his job." Id. at 135. The Brady Court's description of the relevant factual background, however, strongly suggests that some accommodation was possible. See id. at 131 (noting that a supervisor had admitted that "new employees were typically given a training period and that [plaintiff] should have been given more time to learn the job"). The Brady Court, moreover, also upheld against a sufficiency challenge another claim for disability discrimination, a claim which it acknowledged required the plaintiff to show "that he was [*31]  otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation." Id. at 134. Accordingly, the analysis in Brady was premised on the fact that the plaintiff had sufficiently demonstrated that he was, at least with the aid of some reasonable accommodation, capable of performing the essential functions of the position at issue. Brady, like Parker, therefore indicates only that refusal to accommodate and to engage in a sufficient interactive process may support a claim under the ADA where the plaintiff is, at least with the aid of a reasonable accommodation, qualified for the position at issue.
McBride, 583 F.3d 92, 2009 WL 3163218 at *7 (alteration in original).9
On October 5, 2009, I entered an order permitting the parties to submit supplemental letter briefs addressing whether the decision in McBride has any effect on the foregoing analysis of Furman's reasonable accommodation claim. DE 45. Furman submitted a letter on October 8, 2009, in which he argued that McBride has no such effect. DE 46. The City responded on October 13, 2009. DE 47. It contends that McBride stands for the proposition that, even where an employer abstains from the interactive [*32]  process, the plaintiff still must demonstrate the possible availability of some accommodation to survive summary judgment. Id. Thus, the City argues, Furman's reasonable accommodation claim must fail as a result of McBride. Id. 10
After reviewing the parties' supplemental submissions, I conclude that McBride does not alter my analysis of the claims in this case. As noted above, Furman claims to have requested a reasonable accommodation for his disability, and the City contends only that he did not do so in a way that sufficiently created an obligation on the DOE's part to accommodate his needs. Regardless of how the court views that issue, I conclude, for the reasons set forth above, that the City has failed to show the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Furman's job duties would make it reasonable for the DOE to accommodate his disability in the manner he has identified. If the court adopts that analysis, McBride should not change the result, because implicit in that analysis is the possibility that a jury could find that Furman "is, at least with the aid of a reasonable accommodation, qualified for the position at issue." [*33]  McBride, slip op. at 18. Accordingly, I conclude that nothing in McBride alters the analysis set forth above.
C. Hostile Work Environment
The defendants also seek summary judgment on Furman's hostile work environment claim. "To survive summary judgment on a claim of hostile work environment harassment, a plaintiff must produce evidence that the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment." Aulicino v. New York City Dept. of Homeless Services, 580 F. 3d. 73, 2009 WL 2854028, at *7 (2d. Cir. 2009) (quoting Cruz v. Coach Stores, Inc., 202 F.3d 560, 570 (2d Cir.2000)) (internal quotations omitted). Whether the conduct at issue is sufficiently severe or pervasive depends "on the totality of the circumstances." Cruz, 202 F.3d at 570. Relevant factors include "the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance." National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 103 (2002) (citing Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993)). Conduct that is isolated or episodic is insufficient to sustain a hostile work environment claim. Smith v. New Venture Gear, Inc., 319 Fed. Appx. 52, 56 (2d Cir. 2009).
In support of his hostile work environment claim, Furman points to the meetings and memoranda discussing his absences from work, Ingorgia's demand that he provide a doctor's note for all sick [*34]  time after June 3, 2004 and Ingorgia's insinuation that Furman's absences were due to self-treated illness. Furman Aff. ¶¶ 10, 13. He further alleges that he was treated inappropriately by a DOE physician: specifically, Furman alleges that he was "attacked, badgered and accused of lying" and that the physician was "unduly abusive." Id. ¶ 11. Furman argues that the school's principal, Goldberg, harassed him and, consistent with her stated desire to have him "out" of the school, threatened to reduce his performance rating if he did not seek transfer to another school. Id. ¶ 19. Furman further alleges that Goldberg called him stupid, and that she unfairly critiqued his performance based on his absences. Id. ¶¶ 19-20.
The City disputes these allegations. See Response ¶¶ 3, 5, 8, 9. The parties' factual disagreement, however, is a bar to summary judgment only to the extent that the facts in dispute are material. I conclude that they are not. Even accepting Furman's allegations to be true, they simply do not rise to the level of frequency or severity necessary to sustain a hostile work environment claim. See Weiss v. Hustedt Chevrolet, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59408, 2009 WL 2132444, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. July 13, 2009) (granting summary judgment to defendants where employer made three "crass and inappropriate" [*35]  comments linking plaintiff's diabetes with impotence over a nine year period); Nuchman v. City of New York, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56256, 2009 WL 1924756, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. July 1, 2009) (finding that complained-of conduct amounted to "a handful of rude remarks spread out over the course of five school years[,]" that plaintiff had failed to establish that her poor rating was due to her disability, and granting summary judgement to defendants). Furman has not cited any evidence that his job performance was disrupted; nor has he alleged that he ever felt humiliated or physically threatened.
Because Furman has not adduced sufficient evidence upon which a jury could find the City liable for creating a hostile work environment, I respectfully recommend that the court grant the defendants' motion for summary judgment on this aspect of his claim.
III. Recommendation
For the reasons set forth above, I respectfully recommend that the court deny the defendants' motion for summary judgment on plaintiff John Furman's discrimination and reasonable accommodation claims, and grant the defendants' motion for summary judgment on his hostile work environment claim.
IV. Objections
Any objections to this Report and Recommendation must be filed with the Clerk no later than November 2, 2009. Failure to file objections [*36]  within this period waives the right to appeal the District Court's order. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2); Beverly v. Walker, 118 F.3d 900 (2d Cir. 1997); Savoie v. Merchants Bank, 84 F.3d 52 (2d Cir. 1996).
