DECISION AND ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
McMahon, C.J.:
Plaintiff Carol S. Jacobson ("Plaintiff") brought this action against her employer, Defendant Capital One Financial Corporation ("Defendant"), alleging claims of: (1) disability discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. and the New York State Human Rights Law ("NYSHRL"), N.Y. Exec. Law § 290 et seq.; (2) age discrimination, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (the "ADEA"), as amended and the NYSHRL; and, (3) retaliation for her exercise of rights under the ADA, ADEA, NYSHRL, and the Family and Medical Leave Act (the "FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq.
Before the Court is Defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. ("Compl.", Dkt. No. 1.) For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's motion is GRANTED.

Factual Background
The following facts are drawn from evidence in the record and the Parties' Local Rule 56.1 statements. [*2]  They are undisputed except where noted.

I. The Parties
Plaintiff Carol Jacobson was born in 1954. (Statement of Undisputed Material Facts Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1 in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. ("Def.'s 56.1") at ¶ 1, Dkt. No. 44.) She was an employee of Defendant Capital One, starting in 2004. (Id. at ¶ 2.) Plaintiff is a citizen of New York State. (Compl. at ¶ 9.)
Defendant bank is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in Virginia. (Compl. at ¶ 10.) Defendant hired Plaintiff in 2004 to work as Vice President, Underwriter in the Small Business Financial Services group at Defendant's Melville, New York office. (Id. at ¶ 2.)
Plaintiff has a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree, both in Business Administration. (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Local Rule 56.1 Statement of Material Facts and Counterstatement of Material Facts ("Pl.'s Resp. 56.1") at ¶ 273, Dkt. No. 47.) Plaintiff has held positions with several financial institutions, including Chemical Bank and HSBC Securities, Inc. (Id. at ¶ 275.) Immediately prior to her employment with Capital One, Plaintiff worked for JP Morgan Chase & Co. as a Vice President/Credit Products. (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counterstatement of Material Facts ("Def.'s Reply 56.1") [*3]  at ¶ 276, Dkt. No. 53.)
In or around January 2010, Plaintiff applied to transfer positions within Capital One. She applied for a position on the Small Business team, which is a subset of the Special Assets department ("Special Assets"). Plaintiff was hired as a Senior Manager on the Small Business team in January 2010. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 5.) Steve Damore ("Damore") interviewed and hired her for the position. He was also her direct manager. (Id. at ¶ 6.)
Special Assets handled problem loans. (Compl. at ¶ 15). The department was divided into five different teams, which included the Small Business team and the Middle Market and Capital One Equipment Leasing team. All five teams were overseen by the company's Managing Vice President of Special Assets. (Decl. of Aaron Warshaw, Esq. In Supp. Of Def.'s Mot. For Summ. J. ("Warshaw Decl.") Ex. D.) In 2013, David Horsman ("Horsman") served as the Managing Vice President of Special Assets. In mid-2014, he was replaced by Fred Meagher ("Meagher"). (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 16.) Meagher was born in 1958. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 18.)
In 2013, Plaintiff applied for a Senior Manager position on the Capital One Equipment Leasing ("COEF") team. (Def s 56.1 at ¶ [*4]  7.) Vice President Frank Crifasi ("Crifasi") hired Plaintiff for the Senior Manager position. (Id. at ¶ 13.) Crifasi was born in 1951. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 14.) At first, Horsman managed Crifasi. Then, after Horsman left, Meagher managed Crifasi. (Deis 56.1 at ¶¶ 15-16.)
The COEF team was a segment of the Middle Market and Capital One Equipment Leasing team. Crifasi managed both segments of the Middle Market and Capital One Equipment Leasing team: the Middle Markets team and the COEF team. (Id. at ¶ 7.) Plaintiff claims that when she was hired, Crifasi told her that while she was hired for the COEF portfolio, she would be assigned Middle Market work as the COEF work got resolved. Crifasi denied recollection of this statement. (Def.'s Reply 56.1 ¶¶ 300-301.)
As a Senior Manager on the COEF team, Plaintiff reported directly to John Lyons ("Lyons"). Lyons was a Senior Director on the COEF team. Lyons reported to Crifasi. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 302.) Lyons was born in 1946. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 20.)
At all relevant times, there were two other members of the COEF team. Victoria Brown ("Brown") was a Manager. She also reported to Lyons. (Id. at ¶ 21.) Robin Karol ("Karol") assisted the team [*5]  as an Administrative Assistant. (Id. at ¶ 23.) Brown and Karol were Plaintiff s contemporaries. Brown was born in 1956. (Id. at ¶ 22.) Karol was born in 1954. (Id. at ¶ 24.)
During the time Plaintiff was a part of the COEF team, the team consisted of a mix of men and women. Every member of the team was over 50 years old and a member of the protected class under the ADEA. In fact, most of the team was close in age. Lyons, the oldest member of the team, is eight years older than Plaintiff. Crifasi is three years older than Plaintiff. Karol is the same age as Plaintiff. Brown is two years younger than Plaintiff and Meagher is four years younger than Plaintiff.
The COEF team was primarily responsible for resolving distressed commercial leasing loans for Defendant. (Id. at ¶ 7.)
As Senior Manager, Plaintiff was responsible for collecting loans or leases on a group of accounts, which involved negotiating with customers, analyzing situations to determine the best courses of action, and getting approval for those actions. (Id. at ¶ 25.) Plaintiff also completed Watch and Criticize ("WAC") reports, impairment forms, and credit approval forms. (See Warshaw Decl. Ex. H ("Lyons Dep. Tr.") at 46:15-47: [*6]  23; Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 26.) WAC reports consisted of updates on account reserves and were used as part of the approval process for accounts of over one million dollars. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 27.) These reports were a pivotal part of impairments, which were "extremely important" documents for accounting purposes. (Id. at ¶ 28.) They were ultimately submitted at quarterly non-accrual meetings, and were reviewed by senior management, auditors and/or the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, depending on the thresholds of the accounts included in the WAC report. (Id. at ¶ 32.)
Generally, Plaintiff submitted her reports directly to Lyons for review, who then submitted them to Crifasi. (Id. at ¶ 30.) If Lyons was not available, Plaintiff would submit her reports directly to Crifasi. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 31.)

II. Plaintiff's Cancer Diagnosis and Short-Term Disability Leave
On or about November 1, 2013, Plaintiff was diagnosed with lung cancer. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 39.) Plaintiff met with Lyons soon thereafter to inform him of her diagnosis and to tell him that she was going to have surgery and undergo chemotherapy. (Id. at ¶ 40.) Plaintiff testified that she found Lyons to be "very gracious [*7]  about it." (Id. at ¶ 41.)
On or about November 8, 2013, Lyons advised Crifasi and Horsman of Plaintiff's surgery, chemotherapy, and need for leave. (Id. at ¶ 43.) Crifasi advised Lyons that Plaintiff should contact Human Resources ("HR") to ensure she was receiving all benefits to which she was entitled. (Id. at ¶ 44.)
Plaintiff filed a claim with Defendant's third-party vendor, Aetna, for Short-Term Disability ("STD") leave and intermittent FMLA leave.1 (Id. at ¶ 45.) Lyons worked with Aetna to approve Plaintiff's request for benefits. (Id. at ¶ 46.)
Plaintiff was approved for STD leave from November 19, 2013 through December 8, 2013. (Id. at ¶ 47.) Plaintiff was also approved for intermittent FMLA leave four days per every three weeks through June 10, 2014. (Id. at ¶ 48.)
Plaintiff understood that she was not supposed to be working when she went out on leave. (Id. at ¶ 58.) Indeed, prior to her leave, she provided her colleagues with information so that they could take over her work. On November 15, 2013, she sent Lyons and Brown an email attaching a list of her accounts with details on each account. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 311.) She also wrote: "Despite the fact that I know I [*8]  am not supposed to, I shall bring my laptop home. I will check it when I am able." (Id.) Lyons never responded to her email. (Id. at ¶ 312.)
On November 18, 2013, Plaintiff underwent a lobectomy. (Def.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 49.) For the first three weeks after surgery, Plaintiff felt groggy from her medication and was unable to work. She did not go onto her computer to check work during this time. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 ¶ 51.)
On or about December 4, 2013, two weeks and two days after surgery, Plaintiff told some coworkers that she intended to return to work the following week, when her approved STD leave expired. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 52.) Plaintiff testified that normally, people who undergo a lobectomy are on "heavy duty painkillers for six to eight weeks," but that she did not experience the serious pain normally attendant to the surgery, so she did not require strong pain medication for this extended period. (Decl. of Ann L. Clark in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. ("Clark Decl."), Ex. 1 ("Jacobson Dep. Tr.") at 112:4-5, Dkt. No. 48.) She testified that "they were quite shocked at the doctor's office that I wasn't having pain issues at that point." (Id. at 112:6-11.) Plaintiff testified that [*9]  her doctors did not express an opinion as to whether she should return to work at this time and told her it was her choice. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 52.)
Information of Plaintiff's return was relayed to Lyons, who passed it on to Crifasi and Horsman via e-mail. (See Warshaw Decl. Ex. Q.)
Horsman expressed his concern to Lyons and Crifasi that Plaintiff should "follow[] her doctor's orders." (Id.) Horsman told Lyons that Aetna should be communicating with him about the approved leave period, and Lyons responded with confirmation that he was in communication with Aetna. (Id.)
Crifasi asked whether Plaintiff was still on leave and said, "I would assume . . . she shouldn't come in if she is on leave?" He instructed Lyons to contact HR for guidance regarding Plaintiff's return. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 54.) Lyons responded that he assumed she would go off of leave and work it out with HR. (Warshaw Decl. Ex. Q.) Lyons presumed that Plaintiff was returning because she was "bored and want[ed] to get back to work." (Id.)
Plaintiff claims that she returned at that time because she was no longer in pain or on serious medication. She further explained that another reason that she returned was that she was [*10]  "concerned about being out" because she "still had chemo to come." (Jacobson Dep. Tr. at 112:6-11.)
There is no evidence that anyone at Capital One ever asked Plaintiff to return to work prior to the end of her approved leave period or prior to her being well enough to perform her role.

III. Plaintiff's Return to Work and Poor Performance

A. Return to Work
Plaintiff returned to work as soon as her STD leave expired on December 8, 2013. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 309.) In total, Plaintiff was out of work for just three weeks in connection with her surgery. (Id.)
Starting on December 23, 2013, and continuing through the end of February 2014, Plaintiff had chemotherapy treatment for three consecutive days every three weeks. (Id. at ¶ 310.) During this time, Plaintiff was taking intermittent FMLA leave. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 48.) She took the leave to accommodate her treatments.
While undergoing chemotherapy, Plaintiff experienced nausea, exhaustion, memory difficulties, loss of hair, extreme weakness, and decreased vision. (Id. at ¶ 60.) Plaintiff was on three different medications as well as steroids. (Id. at ¶ 61.) She testified that she was "not in good shape at all" and "was not [herself]." (Id. [*11]  at ¶ 62.) Plaintiff uses the term "chemo brain" to describe that she felt foggy and was not thinking clearly, which impacted her memory. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 94.) While experiencing these side effects and "chemo brain," Plaintiff told Lyons that they impaired her ability to do her work well. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 64.)
Despite having been approved for intermittent leave, and although she was not going to the office every day, Plaintiff voluntarily worked every day during the period of time she was undergoing chemotherapy—including on days when she was actually getting her treatment. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶¶ 59, 67.) Plaintiff testified that this included attending team meetings by phone. (Jacobson Dep. Tr. 116:19-117:5.)
Plaintiff made her own, voluntary choice to work during these times. None of Defendant's employees ever instructed Plaintiff to work during her treatment, criticized her for not working while she was receiving treatment, or suggested that being out on leave would negatively impact her job. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶¶ 65, 66.)
Nevertheless, other than the occasional request when she felt particularly ill, Plaintiff did not ask for additional time off even though she was experiencing these [*12]  side effects. When asked why she didn't request additional time off if she was aware she was making errors, Plaintiff said, "I just felt there was so much work to be done at that point and to take more time off would hurt my team and also if my being sick was an issue with anybody, it would make it worse. I felt 100 percent vulnerable at that stage." (Jacobson Dep. Tr. at 133:13-21.) When asked whether she agreed that she should have taken additional leave, Plaintiff testified, "In retrospect, absolutely" but "In reality, no." (Id. at 154:4-7.)
I interpret this to mean that Plaintiff did not feel that she could take any more time off. But, no one told her that she could not—there is no evidence that Plaintiff would not have received additional time off or would have been penalized for such a request. In fact, the evidence is completely to the contrary, as Plaintiff's requests for leave were consistently granted and her supervisors exhibited concern for her health. On March 2, 2014, Lyons told Plaintiff to "take it easy" when she emailed him to say that she was having a strong reaction to treatment. (Id. at ¶ 73.) In mid to late March 2014, Crifasi came to the Melville office and informed [*13]  Plaintiff that he was concerned about her health. (Def.'s Reply 56.1 at ¶ 342.) Furthermore, Lyons and Crifasi testified that they urged Plaintiff to discuss the possibility of additional time off with HR. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶¶ 73, 84.) Plaintiff denies that Lyons and Crifasi said this. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 84.)
Plaintiff's chemotherapy treatment ended in or around late February 2014. At this time, Plaintiff returned to work full time, even though she was approved for FMLA leave through June 2014. (Id. at ¶ 69.) She opted not to take additional intermittent leave or to request any additional disability leave.
When Plaintiff returned to work, she still had chemotherapy in her system and she continued to experience strong side effects from medications related to the chemotherapy treatment. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 70.) Plaintiff repeatedly recognized that the side effects continued to impact her performance. In fact, she told Crifasi about the side effects and described how they impacted her work. (Def.'s Reply 56.1 at ¶ 344.) These side effects lasted through April 2014. (Id. at ¶ 71.)

B. Decline in Performance
Starting when she returned from her STD leave in December 2013, Plaintiff made errors [*14]  in her work, particularly on her impairments and WAC reports. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 77.) According to Defendant, after Plaintiff returned from medical leave, every WAC report she submitted to Crifasi until March was incorrect, and Plaintiff had the highest error rate in the organization for the number of reports that she completed. (Id. at ¶¶ 78-79.) Defendant contends that most of Ciifasi's subordinates completed 35-40 reports, with one or two rejected, but that Plaintiff completed six reports, all of which were rejected due her errors. (Id. at ¶ 80.)
Plaintiff admits that she made errors while she was experiencing side effects from her chemotherapy treatment, including errors transposing some numbers on her reporting forms submitted for review. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶¶ 77, 83, 328.) She also admitted these mistakes at the time she made them. For example, in a February 2014 email to Lyons, she wrote that she did not "do the best job" on reports she had just submitted. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 83.)
Plaintiff contends that the errors she made were not so many in number that they could not have been caught during the normal review process. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 77.) She disagrees that she had the [*15]  highest error rate in the company. (Id. at ¶ 79). However, she admits that she made errors and she offers no evidence that anyone else made more errors.
While Plaintiff was plainly afraid that she would suffer at work if she took full advantage of the leave that was given to her or requested additional leave, there is no evidence that her fear was grounded in fact. By returning to work full-time before her allotted leave was over and while experiencing significant side effects, Plaintiff put herself in a position where she could not and did not perform her job in a satisfactory manner.

IV. The Informal Coaching Plan
On or about April 8, 2014, Crifasi placed Plaintiff on a 90-day coaching plan ("the coaching plan"). The coaching plan was an informal performance plan, which was approved by Horseman and HR. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 96.) Defendant contends that Lyons understood the need to put Plaintiff on the coaching plan, while Plaintiff contends that Lyons told her that he had argued against it. (Id. at ¶ 97; Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 96.)
The purpose of the coaching plan was to improve Plaintiff's performance in key areas—including by preparing complete, accurate, and timely reports and effectively [*16]  managing accounts—as well as to provide her with additional guidance from her supervisors, including a closer review of her work. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶¶ 99-100.) During the coaching plan, Crifasi also moved some accounts away from Plaintiff, which Defendant contends was to lighten her workload so she could focus on her accuracy. (Id. at ¶ 101.) These accounts were not returned to Plaintiff after the coaching plan ended; this was because most of them were settled during the time they were reassigned, and the size of the COEF group's portfolio had been substantially reduced. (Def.'s Reply 56.1 at ¶ 365.)
Crifasi and Lyons met with Plaintiff to discuss the coaching plan before it went into effect. (Id. at ¶ 98.) During this meeting, Plaintiff did not deny that she was having performance issues. As she testified, "I did not deny anything related to product performance issues because they were certainly there." (Jacobson Dep. Tr. at 153:14-153:17.) She further explained, "I had a real issue going on and I made the errors and I took ownership of them and I still will." (Id. at 154:23-155:3.) Crifasi made it clear to Plaintiff that there had also been issues with her performance as a member of [*17]  the COEF team prior to her going out on medical leave. (Def.'s Reply 56.1 at ¶ 98.) Plaintiff told Crifasi and Lyons that her physical problems were over and insisted that there would be no further issues. (Id. at ¶¶ 102-103.)
When asked for her perspective regarding the coaching plan meeting, Plaintiff testified that the "gist of it was that there were issues with my overall performance from day one which was never communicated to me or to [Lyons] and this was supposed to help me perform appropriately and [Crifasi] would be there to coach me and help me the whole way." (Jacobson Dept. Test. at 152:21-153:3.) She testified, "I told [Crifasi] that the issues he had had were not normal. They were due to the impact of chemo and that as the chemo wore off, I would do better. I did not deny anything related to product performance issues because they were certainly there . . ." (Id. at 153:11-153:16; Def.'s Reply 56.1 at ¶ 352.)
Plaintiff claims that Crifasi also told her that if she was not able to work during her treatment, she should have taken more leave. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 353.) Defendant denies that Crifasi made this statement, and claims that Crifasi (and Lyons) told Plaintiff to [*18]  contact HR if she continued to have issues so that she could make sure she was using all of her benefits. (Def.'s Reply 56.1 at ¶ 353.) I will assume for the purposes of this motion that Plaintiff is correct about what Crifasi said—noting that Plaintiff was entitled to take more leave but elected to come back to work too soon without taking all of the leave she had been given.
As part of the coaching plan, Plaintiff had weekly conference calls with Crifasi and Lyons, during which Plaintiff would discuss the projects on which she was working. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 358.) Plaintiff contends that Crifasi and Lyons failed to provide her with guidance during these calls; Defendant contends that Crifasi and Lyons gave her feedback and offered support. Plaintiff testified that these calls were "positive . . . because [I] was able to get a lot of work done by talking to [Crifasi] directly" but claims that "he didn't have anything to add with the exception of one time." (Jacobson Dep. Tr. 156:11-156:15.)
At the end of the 90 days, Plaintiff was told orally that she had successfully completed the coaching plan. (Def.'s Reply 56.1 at ¶ 360.) Despite Plaintiff's requests, Crifasi did not provide [*19]  Plaintiff with written confirmation that she successfully completed the plan. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 361.)
Plaintiff did not request any additional accommodations when the coaching plan was issued, nor did she request accommodations during its implementation. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 185.) Indeed, in May 2014—after Plaintiff asked for help finding a form—Plaintiff told an HR representative who followed up that she was "not looking for an accommodation." (Warshaw Decl. Ex. X; Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 110.) She insisted she was no longer suffering from the most significant side effects of her treatment. (Id.) Plaintiff testified that she was afraid to ask for additional assistance due to the fact that she had already been placed on a coaching plan. (Id.) Plaintiff did not request any additional accommodations for the entirety of 2014.
At or around the time Crifasi placed Plaintiff on her coaching plan, Crifasi also placed Lyons on his own coaching plan. (Warshaw Decl. Ex. Z.) Crifasi's decision was largely based on the fact that Lyons had failed to review Plaintiff's inaccurate reports closely enough before submitting them to Crifasi. (Id.) Lyons' coaching plan focused on timely and accurate [*20]  submission of his work to his managers and effective management of the COEF team. (Id.) The plan was also constructed with the assistance of HR. (Id.) As with Plaintiff, Crifasi met with Lyons to discuss the details of the plan prior to it taking effect, and he had weekly calls with Lyons while the plan was in effect to provide further support. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 106.)

V. Plaintiff's Continued Poor Performance
According to Defendant, Plaintiff's performance declined again after she went off the coaching plan. Defendant contends that during the fall and winter of 2013-2014, Plaintiff: made continued errors in her impairment forms, (Warshaw Decl. Ex. BB); misunderstood what was being asked of her, (Warshaw Decl. Ex. E. ("Crifasi Dep. Tr.") at 196:18-197:20; Warshaw Decl. Ex. CC); confused her co-workers and managers, (Warshaw Decl. Ex. DD); and, became involved with work that was outside her purview, (Warshaw Decl. Ex. EE). (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 112.)
Plaintiff argues generally that the documents Defendant points to did not reflect deficiencies in her performance. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 112.) Plaintiff only provides specific evidence with respect to the errors on her impairment form, which she [*21]  says were in fact correct when she submitted them; she alleges that Meagher was confused about the balances reported in the form, but that the numbers she used (the quarter end numbers for the WAC and the date of preparation for the impairment form) were correct. (Id.) Plaintiff provides no evidence that any of the other instances of poor performance Defendant identifies did not occur.

VI. Defendant's Review Process and Plaintiff's 2014 Performance Review

A. Performance Appraisal Process
As part of Defendant's review process, employees were reviewed annually, and in some cases, semi-annually. (Def's 56.1 at ¶ 115.) Performances were rated as falling within one of five categories (from highest to lowest): exceptional, very strong, strong, inconsistent, or action required. (Id. at ¶ 116.) According to the rating system, an "Inconsistent" rating signified that an employee performed well in some areas, but not well in others. (Id. at ¶ 142.) An employee could be ranked in the high or low end of each category, although this gradation was not apparent from the face of the performance appraisal form. (Id. at ¶ 117.)
The review process started in the fourth quarter of each year. Managers would [*22]  recommend employee rankings, which were used to generate an initial report of all recommendations. (Id. at ¶¶ 120-121.) Upper management then held "Calibration Meetings" to determine which employees should fall within which range. (Id. at ¶ 122.) Employees' ratings were calibrated and measured against their peers. (Id. at ¶ 118.) Employees were calibrated level by level, then across their department. (Id. at ¶ 123.)
Before or soon after these calibration meetings, supervisors prepared initial drafts of comprehensive performance appraisals for each of their direct reports. (Id. at ¶ 124.) When drafting these appraisals, a supervisor had access to an employee's self-evaluation, which was a standardized evaluation form sent to all employees. (Id. at ¶ 128.) A supervisor also had access to "360 feedback" for each employee, which consisted of evaluations of the employee by the employee's peers. (Id. at ¶ 125.) To obtain 360 feedback, an employee would ask one or more of her peers to provide her management with a review of her performance. (Id.) A supervisor could also ask an employee to provide 360 feedback on another employee's performance. (Id.) The purpose of 360 feedback was to control [*23]  for manager bias. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 126.) A supervisor used both the self-evaluation and the 360 feedback to assist in drafting an appraisal.
Multiple levels of supervisors would then review the draft appraisal. The immediate supervisor of the employee being reviewed would discuss the appraisal with his direct manager, the second-tier manager of the employee being reviewed. (Id. at ¶ 124.) The second-tier manager would then choose whether to share the appraisal with his own manager. (Id.)
The COEF team followed these standard procedures. Crifasi asked his direct reports to request 360 feedback from at least three peers. He also asked that his direct reports, including Lyons, have their direct reports, including Plaintiff, request 360 feedback. (Id. at ¶ 127.) Each employee was also responsible for completing the standardized self-evaluation form. (Id. at ¶ 128.)
Crifasi first met with Lyons to discuss the performance ratings of Lyons' direct reports, including Plaintiff. Lyons then wrote a first draft of the performance appraisal for each of his reports. Crifasi and Lyons met again to discuss the content of Lyons' drafts. (Id. at ¶ 129.) Crifasi then reviewed and submitted Lyons' proposed [*24]  appraisals to his own manager (either Horsman or Meagher, depending on the year) for him to review. (Id. at ¶ 130.)

B. The Drafting of Plaintiff's 2014 Performance Appraisal
Meagher and Crifasi first began discussing Plaintiff's 2014 rating as early as September 2014. (Warshaw Decl. Ex. 00.) On September 18, 2018, Meagher sent an email to Crifasi asking, "Aren't we making John [Lyons] and Carol inconsistent?" Crifasi responded, "Was thinking the low end of Strong. . . I am ok going with Carol as Inconsistent but John should be low end of strong as I did last year. . . ." (Id.) Meagher replied that he believed Lyons was "Inconsistent" as he "does not act as a Senior Director." (Id.) Crifasi wrote back, "I just went back and read guidance on different levels and I guess I can not really support the Strong rating for either one. . . I concur." (Id.) Crifasi later relayed to Lyons that Plaintiff's performance appraisal should be written to reflect his and Meagher's assessment that Plaintiff merited an "Inconsistent" rating. (Def.'s Reply 56.1 at ¶ 374.)
Plaintiff submitted her self-evaluation in January of 2015. (Id. at ¶ 133.) In her self-evaluation, Plaintiff did not discuss her coaching [*25]  plan, which she testified was per Lyons' instruction. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 134.)
Plaintiff received 360 feedback reviews from three of her peers: Jayson Stambovsky, an employee in the credit department; Allison DePaolo ("DePaolo"), one of Meagher's direct reports who helped Crifasi with the COEF portfolio; and Karol, her colleague on the COEF team. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 135.) Plaintiff was copied on the 360 review submitted by Karol, but not on the others. (Warshaw Decl. Ex. LL.)
Plaintiff asked Stambovsky and Karol to provide 360 feedback. It is not clear as to who asked DePaolo to provide 360 feedback—both Plaintiff and Crifasi testified that they reached out to DePaolo. Crifasi further testified that he asked DePaolo in order to get an objective third- party opinion of Plaintiff's performance. (Crifasi Dep. Tr. at 212:5-212:15.) According to Crifasi, this was a common thing for a manager to do. (Id.)
Feedback on Plaintiff from Stambovsky and Karol was generally positive, but DePaolo's feedback was more negative. (Warshaw Decl. Ex. LL.) DePaolo wrote that Plaintiffs constant complaining and negative attitude were "very distracting" and caused a "toxic environment" for anyone with whom [*26]  she worked. (Id.) She said that Plaintiff "comes off as very negative," and "often puts down the leadership and [her team's] practices." (Id.) DePaolo also wrote that Plaintiff never seemed to have a sense of urgency, that she "pushes things off on others," and that she had a lot of excuses as to "why things are not getting done or cannot get done." (Id.) DePaolo concluded that ultimately, with Plaintiff, "Everything seems to be somebody's fault." (Id.)
Lyons began writing Plaintiff's 2014 performance appraisal in early 2015. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 131.) He collaborated with HR on Plaintiffs appraisal, as he did for his other direct report, Brown. (Id. at ¶ 132.) On January 14, 2015, Lyons sent a draft of Plaintiff's appraisal to Crifasi and HR Director Kelley O'Hara ("O'Hara"). (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 376.)
Lyons' draft clearly described Plaintiffs performance issues. He identified the errors in her reports and missing reports. (Warshaw Decl. Ex. LL.) He also wrote that her communication skills were "disappointing this year," that she was "too often critical of her other teammates who support her in her daily responsibilities," and that she needed a "more positive attitude." (Id.) Twice, [*27]  Lyons tied Plaintiffs attitude and judgment issues to the effects of her cancer treatment. He wrote that Plaintiff "returned to work too soon" and "while taking a strong painkiller," and that this decision had "influenced her ability to communicate and exercise sound judgment." (Id.)
Lyons worked with Crifasi and HR to revise the performance appraisal. On January 26, 2015, Lyons forwarded his revisions to Crifasi and O'Hara, and wrote that he had "tried to be responsive to [their] comments from [their] previous conversations." (Pl.'s Resp. 561 at ¶ 377.) The new version had multiple edits, including adding more detail about Plaintiff's communication skills and future development opportunities for Plaintiff. (Clark. Decl. Ex. 20.) It focused more on Plaintiff's performance throughout the entire year. The new version also edited out specific references to Plaintiff's treatment, though it did include Lyons' statement that "2014 was a difficult year for Carol." (Id.)
Defendant and Plaintiff agree that her performance issues at the beginning of 2014 were connected to her medical condition, and that she returned to work too soon. Plaintiff contends that her review should not have been edited [*28]  to remove that fact, but while Plaintiff sees something problematic—a covering up of discrimination—in excising Lyons' references to the relationship between her treatment and her performance, the obvious reason is that HR departments are (wrongfully) trained never to refer in reviews to matters that could be (but not necessarily are) the product of discrimination. The fact is, Plaintiff's performance suffered when she returned to work too soon. Reference to that in a year-end review is not evidence of discrimination; it is reality.

C. Plaintiff's 2014 Performance Appraisal
Plaintiff received an overall "Inconsistent" rating for 2014. (Warshaw Decl. Ex. MM.) This means that she performed well in some areas and not others. She was "partially meeting expectations." (Warshaw Decl. Ex. GG.)
The review had multiple components. (Warshaw Decl. Ex. MM) Plaintiff was first rated on three "Results."
Under the first "Result," "Maximize the Return on all Assets," Plaintiff received a "Strong" rating. (Id.) The explanation for the rating read, "Carol had several successful recoveries during 2014 including: . . . a 700K recovery; . . . a 500K recovery and . . . an 85K settlement. These accomplishments [*29]  contributed to the overall reduction in the number and account of Non-Accrual loans managed by COEF SA." (Id.)
Under the second, "Credit Management," Plaintiff received an "Inconsistent" rating. (Id.) The explanation read, "Carol needs to focus on the accuracy of the reports she prepares. There have been a number of inaccurate reports submitted which required re-work." (Id.) The comment specifically referenced errors in a "third quarter impairment" and Plaintiff's failure to submit a TDR report in April 2014. (Id.)
Under the third, "Communication/Teamwork/Leadership Skills/Talent Management," Plaintiff received an "Inconsistent" rating. (Id.) The appraisal stated that Plaintiff's communication skills were "disappointing" and that her "attitude towards senior management resulted in negative reactions by senior management. . . ." (Id.)
Plaintiff was also rated on nine "Competencies." Plaintiff received an "Overall Competency Rating" of "Inconsistent." Plaintiff received a rating of "Strong" for three competencies—Problem Solving, Customer Focus, and Job-Specific Skills—and "Inconsistent" for six—Communication, Influence, Judgment, Teamwork, Lives the Values, and Results Focus. There was [*30]  no further description for these ratings. (Id.)
Plaintiff's "Strengths" were that she had strong credit skills, which she used effectively, and that she was focused on her customers. Plaintiff's "Development Opportunities" were that she needed a more positive attitude and to improve the accuracy of her reports. (Id.)
In the "Overall Summary," Lyons wrote:
2014 was a difficult year for Carol. While she had some successes, she fell short on a number of competencies. Her negative attitude and complaints are hard on the people she works with and her managers. It gets in the way of accomplishing our goals and objectives. Carol also needs to focus on accurate preparation of reports she prepares. Further she needs to focus on completing and preparing required reports in a timely manner. . . .
(Id.)
Lyons also received an "Inconsistent" rating for 2014. (Warshaw Decl. Ex. PP.) Brown received a "Very Strong" rating. (Id.)

D. The Impact of the 2014 Performance Appraisal

1. Plaintiff's Salary and Bonus
Defendant used performance appraisals as the basis for merit-based salary increases and bonuses. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 189-190.) The initial range of compensation was driven by performance ratings, but management [*31]  had some flexibility to distribute money within their departments. (Id. at ¶ 195.) HR provided managers, including Crifasi, with the salary and bonus ranges for each position under their jurisdiction, as well as a budget for the entire department. (Id. at ¶ 192.) HR also provided a minimum, maximum, and suggested amount for each particular employee. (Id. at ¶¶ 193, 195.)
Crifasi met with his direct reports to discuss compensation for their direct reports. (Id. at ¶ 196.) Crifasi's supervisor and the Chief Human Resource Officer both had to approve the proposed allocations. (Id. at ¶ 198.)
In 2014, Plaintiff received a merit increase of 0.015% and a bonus of $10,500. (Id. at ¶¶ 208-209.) In the previous year, 2013, Plaintiff had received a "Strong" rating, a merit increase of 0.0225%, and a bonus of $23,000, which was prorated to take into account the weeks she was out on leave in connection with her cancer treatment. (Id. at ¶¶ 205-206.)

2. New Coaching Plan
It was "normal practice" to place those who received an "Inconsistent" rating on a coaching plan or a performance improvement plan. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 151.) The employee's manager had discretion as to which type of plan. The performance [*32]  improvement plan was a more formal option. (Id. at 152.)
After Plaintiff's "Inconsistent" review, Lyons and Crifasi worked with HR to draft another coaching plan for Plaintiff. (Def.'s Reply 56.1 at ¶ 408.)
Lyons worked with HR to create an initial draft of the plan. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 409.) Throughout February 2015, he had multiple meetings with HR Representative Jennifer Moran ("Moran") and/or O'Hara to discuss his management of Plaintiff and the contents of the new plan. Prior to these meetings, Moran prepared notes about Plaintiff, including that she had medical issues in the past and that she was 60 years old. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶¶ 410-411.) At one of these meetings, on February 26, 2015, Lyons told HR that Crifasi was not happy with Plaintiff's performance and that this was largely because of Plaintiff's attitude. (Id. at ¶ 413.)
On or around March 25, 2015, Lyons told HR that he could not approve some of the comments on the most recent draft of the plan, which had been proposed by HR. He said that Plaintiff was already meeting the expectations HR included, such as a request that Plaintiff "use a communication style that is respectful" and "focus on having verbal discussions rather [*33]  than only IM chats." (Clark Decl. Ex. 29.) He believed that the plan as drafted was "too critical." (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 419.) HR incorporated Lyons' feedback into a new version. (Id. at ¶ 424.)
Plaintiff was never placed on a second coaching plan. (Id. at ¶ 480.)

E. Plaintiff's Response to the 2014 Performance Appraisal
On or around February 4, 2015, Plaintiff met with Lyons to discuss her performance appraisal. She told him that she did not agree with the "Inconsistent" rating and asserted that her performance and attitude had improved after her coaching plan. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶¶ 143-144, 157.) Defendant says that Plaintiff also complained about the way the department was managed and various other issues, including her unhappiness with her managers. Specifically, she said that Lyons did not give her enough attention. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶¶ 145-146.) Plaintiff claims that she told Lyons that the COEF team lacked the resources to perform its work. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 145.) During this conversation, Lyons and Plaintiff also discussed her attitude toward senior management, particularly during non-accrual meetings. (Id. at ¶ 146.)
Plaintiff asserted no claims of discrimination or unfair treatment [*34]  at this meeting. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 147.)
Plaintiff submitted a written rebuttal to her 2014 Performance Appraisal through the company's HR portal. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 158.) On February 26, 2015, Lyons also forwarded the rebuttal to HR. (Id. at ¶ 159.)
In her rebuttal, Plaintiff admitted that her chemotherapy had impacted her ability to work. She said that while she had tried to work through the side effects, "this was not successful." (Warshaw Decl. Ex. UU.) Plaintiff conceded that she came back to work too early and that this had caused her to make mistakes. She said that, in retrospect, she agreed with Crifasi's statement that she "should have taken additional leave instead of coming back." (Id.)
But while Plaintiff admits making errors, she disagreed with the appraisal's description of her errors. With respect to the impairment form referenced in the appraisal, she asserted that a delay in review by the different levels of signers caused a mismatch in the numbers (which changed over her time), not her own error. She claimed that the numbers were correct when she submitted them. She further alleged that a failure to provide a specific document (an "ARF") was Lyons' error and not hers. [*35]  (Id) Plaintiff admitted that she did not submit a "TDR" form in April, but claims that she raised and resolved the issue appropriately. (Id.)
Plaintiff also disagreed with the appraisal's description of her attitude. She wrote that, "Complaints were made to me, not by me" and that the statements with respect to her attitude were "out of the blue." (Id.)
Plaintiff highlighted her compliance with the informal coaching plan and wrote that "since that period, I haven't received any feedback from [Lyons] or [Crifasi]," other than instructions to stop complaining about lack of resources. (Id.)
Generally, Plaintiff wrote that she did not think the review accurately reflected her performance. (Id.) She ended the rebuttal by saying, "I cannot help thinking that I am being viewed differently since my cancer treatment." (Id.)
In addition to submitting a written rebuttal, Plaintiff contacted HR directly to address her concerns. She was connected with Lisa Barrett ("Barrett"), who spoke with Plaintiff on or around March 10, 2015. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶¶ 162-163.) During the conversation, Plaintiff told Barrett that she did not agree with her "Inconsistent" rating and that she should have been given a higher [*36]  rating. (Id. at ¶¶ 164-166.) Yet, Plaintiff again admitted that, in retrospect, she should have taken additional time off of work. (Id. at ¶ 168.)
On or about March 27, 2015, Plaintiff provided Barrett with documents that she believed would rebut the issues in her rating. (Warshaw Decl. Ex. XX.) Barrett treated Plaintiff's concerns as a complaint of discrimination based on her medical condition. (Def's 56.1 at if 170.) Barrett offered to set up a meeting with Plaintiff, Crifasi, and Lyons to discuss Plaintiff's complaint, but Plaintiff declined to participate. (Pl.'s Resp. 56. 1 at ¶ 438.)
Barrett spoke with Lyons and Crifasi without Plaintiff on or around April 8, 2015. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶¶ 172-174.) Barrett's notes from this conversation reflect that she reviewed Plaintiff's concerns with Lyons and Crifasi. They were "adamant" that Plaintiff never requested an accommodation. They also said that Plaintiff's errors were "deplorable," and that her work had become careless again towards the end of 2014. Lyons stated that Plaintiff had developed "an attitude of disgust," and that feedback from others was that she was "unfriendly." (Warshaw Decl. Ex. WW.)
Based on her conversation with Plaintiff, [*37]  her review of Plaintiff's documents, and her conversation with Lyons and Crifasi, Barrett found no evidence of discrimination or unfair treatment. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 188.) She concluded that there was nothing misleading or false about Plaintiff's review; Lyons and Crifasi agreed with each other, and Plaintiff repeatedly admitted that she had made errors. (Id. at ¶ 187.) Barrett concluded that Plaintiff simply did not agree with the plan or her rating.
On or around April 9, 2015, Barrett relayed her finding to Plaintiff and provided Plaintiff with a close-out review of her concerns. (Id at ¶ 186.)
On April 16, 2015, Plaintiff's attorneys sent Defendant a letter, asserting claims of disability discrimination and retaliation on Plaintiff's behalf. (Clark Decl. Ex. 41.)
On May 4, 2015, having received no response to the April 16, 2015 letter, Plaintiff's attorneys sent Defendant a follow-up letter, stating that Plaintiff was going to file charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). (Id. at ¶ 525.)
On May 19, 2015, Barrett sent herself an email containing Plaintiff's HR complaint. On May 20, 2015, she sent herself an email that she was meeting with an external attorney regarding [*38]  Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶¶ 532-533.)

VII. Plaintiff's Internal Job Applications
In late May 2015, a little over a month after the resolution of Plaintiff's complaint to HR, Plaintiff applied for two open positions in the Special Assets department. First, Plaintiff applied for the general position of Director of Special Assets. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 210.) This position would have been a promotion in title. Crifasi was the hiring manager for this position. (Id.)
The position was posted as a "general position in New York." In fact, this was a mistake; the position was specifically related to the energy industry and was based in Texas. (Id. at ¶ 212.) Plaintiff, who did not have the requisite experience required for this job, (id. at 11214), did not receive this position, (id. at ¶ 216). Plaintiff does not believe she was discriminated against by not receiving this position. (Id. at ¶ 215.)
Around the same time, Plaintiff also applied for a Director of Special Assets position in the Taxi Medallion group (the "Taxi group"). (Id. at ¶ 217.) Defendant says that Plaintiff had no experience with taxi medallion accounts, while Plaintiff claims that she had some experience working on taxi loans while on the COEF team. [*39]  (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 224.)
After submitting her application, Plaintiff asked to meet with John O'Gorman ("O'Gorman"), the hiring manager for this position. (Id. at ¶¶ 220-221.) O'Gorman agreed to meet with Plaintiff to discuss the position. (Id. at ¶ 221.)
Whenever O'Gorman was considering an internal candidate, he would inquire about the candidate's prior performance and ratings, as job performance was a key part of his decision whether to hire a person for an open position. (Id. at ¶ 222.) O'Gorman did precisely that prior to meeting with Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 223.) He consulted with his own supervisor, Meagher, about Plaintiff, and Meagher shared Plaintiff's "Inconsistent" rating with O'Gorman. (Id.) At Meagher's suggestion, O'Gorman also spoke with Crifasi about Plaintiff's performance and rating after meeting with Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 511.)
O'Gorman did not select Plaintiff for the position. (Def.'s 56.1. at ¶ 224.) Defendant contends that Plaintiff was not selected because of her lack of experience with taxi medallion accounts and her poor performance during the immediately preceding year. (Id.) At the time he made the decision, O'Gorman was not aware that Plaintiff had complained [*40]  to HR about her review or that she had made any allegations of discrimination. (Id. at ¶ 225.)
O'Gorman hired two candidates to fill positions in the Taxi group. (Id. at ¶ 226.)
The first, Fedor Mikhailov ("Mikhailov"), was an internal hire. He was a director-level employee with Defendant. Mikhailov was recommended internally, received a "very strong" rating for 2014, and was considered a "high potential employee." (Id. at ¶¶ 228-233.) He had a CFA and CPA. (Id. at ¶ 234.) He did not have experience with the taxi industry. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 515.)
The second, Michael Robinson ("Robinson"), was an external candidate. (Id. at ¶ 518.) He had two years of experience as a loan officer in special assets, some of which was in taxi loans. (Id. at ¶ 519.) He also possessed a law degree. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 239.) This was important to Meagher because about one third of the taxi medallion portfolio was in default and required direct litigation against borrowers and guarantors. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 241.)
Both Mikhailov and Robinson were in their thirties and were without known or perceived disabilities. (Id. at ¶ 520.)

VIII. The Reduction in Force ("RIF")
By late 2014 and into early 2015, the COEF group's [*41]  portfolio had reduced in size, and there was less work to be done. (Def.'s 56. 1 at ¶ 243.) COEF team members, including Plaintiff, asked for more work. (Id. at ¶ 244.) Plaintiff was aware her group could be downsizing. (Id. at ¶ 245.)
In or around May 2015, Meagher began to meet with HR to discuss the "possibility" of job elimination in COEF. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 526.) Throughout the "Reduction In Force" ("RIF") process, Meagher worked with HR to determine which positions would be eliminated and how the RIF would be implemented. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶¶ 250, 253.)
On May 13, 2015, Meagher met with Moran and O'Hara to discuss the COEF funding issues and the possibility of job elimination. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 526.) He said that he was considering the elimination of Plaintiff's job. (Id. at ¶ 527) They also discussed putting Lyons on a coaching plan. (Id.)
On May 18, 2015, Meagher met with Crifasi, Moran, and O'Hara. (Def.'s Reply 56.1 at ¶ 528.) The purpose of this meeting was to discuss "next steps" with regards to Plaintiff and Lyons, both of whom had been rated "Inconsistent," and to discuss reduction in force activities in the department. (Id.)
On May 28, 2015, O'Hara sent an email to [*42]  Meagher following up on a phone call. She asked him to send her a formal explanation for the RIF and information about the people identified for termination. Meagher sent her the rationale for the job eliminations on the COEF team and a list of the individuals he recommended be fired: Plaintiff, Lyons, and Karol. (Warshaw Decl. Ex. LLL.) Meagher wrote that Brown would remain on staff, but would be transfered to the Small Business team with what remained of the COEF accounts portfolio. (Id.)
On or about June 25, 2015, Plaintiff was notified that her position was being eliminated as part of the RIF. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 256.) The COEF team no longer existed. Plaintiff's, Lyons' and Karol's positions were eliminated entirely, and Brown was moved to another group in Special Assets. (Id. at ¶ 254.)
Between June 25, 2015 and September 1, 2015, Plaintiff was in "redeployment." (Id at ¶ 257.) Redeployment is the period between notice of termination and the effective date of termination. During this period, Plaintiff was eligible to apply for open positions with Defendant. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 550.) Defendant offered Plaintiff career consulting services as part of her redeployment. (Def.'s 56.1 [*43]  at ¶ 258.)
Plaintiff testified that she applied for a position in the Loan Review department during her redeployment, using the Capital One application system, but that when she returned to view her submission, it was no longer in the system. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶¶ 551-552.) Defendant claims that Plaintiff failed to apply for any position during this period, despite being encouraged to do so. (Def.'s Reply 56.1 at ¶ 552, 556.) There is no evidence, aside from her testimony, that Plaintiff submitted an application during this period, and Plaintiff essentially retracted her testimony in her response to the motion for summary judgment, saying that any application would have been "futile" because of her "Inconsistent" rating. (Pl.'s Resp. at ¶ 553.) There is also no evidence that anyone erased an application from Plaintiff from Capital One's application system.

DISCUSSION

I. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-50, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The moving party has the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a disputed issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A dispute concerning a material fact [*44]  is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Aldrich v. Randolph Cent. Sch. Dist., 963 F.2d 520, 523 (2d Cir. 1992) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248). A genuine issue for trial exists if, based on the record as a whole, a reasonable jury could find in favor of the non-movant. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. In making these determinations, courts must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant. See id. at 255.
To defeat summary judgment, the nonmoving party must go beyond the pleadings and "do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). It is not sufficient for the nonmoving party to present evidence that is conclusory or speculative with no basis in fact. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50. The nonmoving party must present "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Beard v. Banks, 548 U.S. 521, 529, 126 S. Ct. 2572, 165 L. Ed. 2d 697 (2006). Ultimately, summary judgment is meant "to flush out those cases that are predestined to result in directed verdict." Lightfoot v. Union Carbide Corp., 110 F.3d 898, 907 (2d Cir. 1997).
Courts should be "particularly cautious about granting summary judgment to an employer in a discrimination case when the employer's intent is in question" because "direct evidence of an employer's discriminatory intent will rarely be found." Schwapp v. Town of Avon, 118 F.3d 106, 110 (2d Cir. 1997). Nevertheless, "even in the discrimination context, [*45]  a plaintiff must provide more than conclusory allegations of discrimination to defeat a motion for summary judgment." Id.

II. The ADA and NYSHRL Claims
Counts One and Two of the Complaint assert that Defendant's conduct constituted disability discrimination in violation of the ADA and NYSHRL, respectively. The Court considers Plaintiff's ADA and NYSHRL claims together because the analysis under the NYSHRL "parallels that used in the ADA context." Lovejoy—Wilson v. NOCO Motor Fuel, Inc., 263 F.3d 208, 212 n.3 (2d Cir. 2001). Because Plaintiff lives in Woodbury, New York and worked in Melville, New York, there are no claims under the more lenient standard of the New York City Human Rights Law.2

A. Legal Standards
The ADA prohibits an employer from "discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Under the ADA, an employer has an obligation to provide a disabled employee with a reasonable accommodation. See id. at § 12112(b)(5)(A). Discrimination in violation of the ADA includes, inter alia, "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental [*46]  limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity." Id.; see also McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., 583 F.3d 92, 96 (2d Cir. 2009).
The ADA does not prevent an employer from holding an employee accountable for poor job performance. In this Circuit, courts have recognized that, "Discrimination under the ADA is not established if the disability caused unacceptable job performance." Adams v. Rochester Gen. Hosp., 977 F. Supp. 226, 236 (W.D.N.Y. 1997); Teahan v. Metro-N Commuter R. Co., 951 F.2d 511, 517 (2d Cir. 1991). An employer may hold a disabled employee to legitimate performance expectations, as long as the employee has the same opportunity to succeed as nondisabled employees do. See, e.g., Kelley v. Amazon.com, Inc., No. 12-CV-5132-TOR, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166534, 2013 WL 6119229, at *9 (E.D. Wash. Nov. 21, 2013), aff'd, 652 F. App'x 524 (9th Cir. 2016) (citing EEOC guidance and citing cases); see also Fink v. New York City Dep't of Pers., 53 F.3d 565, 567 (2d Cir. 1995). A plaintiff's disability "may not be used to shield him from the adverse consequences of inadequate job performance." Corr v. MTA Long Island Bus, 27 F. Supp. 2d 359, 369 (E.D.N.Y. 1998), aff'd, 199 F.3d 1321 (2d Cir. 1999). When a defendant demonstrates that an adverse consequence was taken due to plaintiff's poor performance, the plaintiff must show that he or she suffered an adverse consequence because of the disability as opposed to the poor performance, to succeed with a claim under the ADA. See, e.g., Wega v. Ctr. for Disability Rights Inc., 395 F. App'x 782, 784 (2d Cir. 2010); De La Rosa v. City of New York Police Dep't, No. 09 CIV. 5290 SAS, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112770, 2010 WL 4177626, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 22, 2010), [*47]  aff'd, 461 F. App'x 73 (2d Cir. 2012).
Claims of disability discrimination under the ADA and NYSHRL are governed by the familiar burden-shifting framework from McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See McBride, 583 F.3d at 96. Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Id. Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, "the burden of production shifts to the defendant, who must articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its challenged actions." Rodal v. Anesthesia Group of Onondaga, P.C., 369 F.3d 113, 118 n.3 (2d Cir. 2004). If the defendant meets this burden, "the plaintiff must then produce evidence and carry the burden of persuasion that the proffered reason is a pretext." Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc., 445 F.3d 161, 169 (2d Cir. 2006). The burden of persuasion that the proffered reason is a pretext is higher than that of the prima facie case—"the key is whether there is sufficient evidence in the record from which a reasonable trier of fact could find in favor of [the] [p]laintiff on the ultimate issue, that is, whether the record contains sufficient evidence to support an inference of discrimination." Clark v. Jewish Childcare Ass'n, Inc., 96 F. Supp. 3d 237, 255 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). "[T]he plaintiff has the ultimate burden of persuasion." Norton v. Sam's Club, 145 F.3d 114, 118 (2d Cir. 1998)
Here, Plaintiff brings two types of discrimination claims [*48]  under the ADA: (1) adverse employment action and (2) failure to accommodate. I address them separately.

B. Adverse Employment Actions
Plaintiff has predicated her adverse employment action claims on four alleged adverse employment actions: (1) her 2014 "Inconsistent" rating; (2) her 2014 bonus and salary increase; (3) Defendant's denial of her application to transfer to another position; and (4) her termination. Plaintiff further contends that her informal coaching plan, while itself not an adverse employment action, serves as evidence of unlawful bias that underlies each of the adverse employment actions.
To make a prima facie case for discrimination under the adverse employment action theory, a plaintiff must demonstrate that "(1) [her] employer is subject to the ADA; (2) [she] was disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (3) [she] was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of [her] job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) [she] suffered adverse employment action because of [her] disability." Sista, 445 F.3d at 169.
Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to establish a prima facie case because she has not demonstrated that (1) she was qualified to perform her job or (2) that she [*49]  suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability. In the alternative, Defendant asserts that even if Plaintiff has established a prima facie case, she fails to show that the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons Defendant offers for each action are pretextual.
The Supreme Court has described the Plaintiff's burden for establishing a prima facie case under the McDonnell Douglas framework as "minimal." St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993); see also Bucalo v. Shelter Island Union Free Sch. Dist., 691 F.3d 119, 128 (2d Cir. 2012). Accordingly, and in line with well-established practice in this and other circuits, I will assume, for purposes of this motion only, that Plaintiff has established a prima facie case. See, e.g., Lapsley v. Columbia Univ.-Coll. of Physicians & Surgeons, 999 F. Supp. 506, 515-16 (S.D.N.Y. 1998); see also Ben-Levy v. Bloomberg, L.P., 518 F. App'x 17, 19 (2d Cir. 2013); Sullivan v. Brodsky, 380 F. App'x 21 (2d Cir. 2010). My focus then with respect to each adverse employment action is on the second and third steps of the McDonnell Douglas framework: whether Defendant has articulated a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for each of Plaintiff's alleged adverse employment actions and, if so, whether Plaintiff produced sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether these reasons are pretextual

1. 2014 "Inconsistent" Rating and 2014 Bonus and Salary
I consider Plaintiff's "Inconsistent" rating and the 2014 bonus and salary together, since the latter [*50]  is linked to the former.
A negative performance evaluation alone does not qualify as an adverse employment action. See Bennett v. Watson Wyatt & Co., 136 F. Supp. 2d 236, 247 (S.D.N. Y. 2001), aff'd in part, appeal dismissed in part, 51 F. App'x 55 (2d Cir. 2002); see also Sanders v. N.Y.C. Human Res. Admin., 361 F.3d 749, 756 (2d Cir. 2004). However, when a poor performance evaluation is connected to a materially adverse change—including a lower salary increase or bonus—the combination is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action. McCowan v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 689 F. Supp. 2d 390, 407 (E.D.N.Y. 2010).
Plaintiff's "Inconsistent" rating is not in and of itself an adverse employment action, but an "Inconsistent" rating that impacts her salary and bonus is. When an employer denies pay that is typically awarded as a "matter of course" or pay that a plaintiff was "otherwise entitled to expect or rely on it," denial of that pay can constitute an adverse employment action. C.f. Davis v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ., No. 10-cv-3812 KAM LB, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30784, 2014 WL 917142, *7 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 7, 2014), aff'd, 804 F.3d 231 (2d Cir. 2015); Graves v. Deutsche Bank Secs. Inc., No. 07 Civ 5471, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25733, 2010 WL 997178, at *2, *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 17, 2010).
Defendant awarded performance-based compensation for salary and bonuses. Defendant's HR department provided managers with a minimum, maximum, and "suggested" amount for each employee; an individual manager's discretion to distribute money was limited, and "compensation was solely tied to performance." (Def.'s Mem. of Law in Supp. [*51]  of Its Mot. for Summ. J., at 15, Dkt. No. 43.) It is therefore reasonable to assume that Defendant's bonuses and salary increases were a "matter of course," and that Plaintiff would rely on receipt of the increase and bonus. This is sufficient to establish that the reduction of both constitutes a materially adverse change to support an allegation of an adverse employment action.

i. Defendant's Legitimate Nondiscriminatory Reason
At the second step in the McDonnell Douglas framework, Defendant provides more than sufficient evidence to satisfy its burden to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Plaintiff's "Inconsistent" rating by pointing to Plaintiff's poor performance—including admitted errors in her work—and her negative impact on her coworkers.
Defendant has demonstrated both that Plaintiff made mistakes on her work product and that Plaintiff has consistently admitted that she made mistakes. Defendant also offers evidence that Plaintiff exhibited a bad attitude in the workplace. This includes that: Plaintiff's coworker, DePaolo, described Plaintiff as having a "negative attitude," which contributed to a "toxic environment in the group"; Plaintiff admitted to saying [*52]  "f*** you" at the end of a phone call with Crifasi, which Crifasi believed was aimed at him; and, Lyons and Crifasi described problems with Plaintiff's attitude (in addition to her performance) when meeting with HR.
Defendant also points out that there is no evidence that Plaintiff was treated any differently than other coworkers. Indeed, Defendant demonstrates that Lyons, a non-disabled employee, was treated similarly to Plaintiff. Lyons, who was making errors and exhibiting poor management skills, was also put on a coaching plan and then received an "Inconsistent" rating for the 2014 year.
Since Defendant has produced sufficient evidence that it acted for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason by rating Plaintiff "Inconsistent," I turn to the third step of the framework. Plaintiff must demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact that the proffered reasons were merely pretext for discrimination, either by the presentation of evidence or by relying on her prima facie case.

ii. Plaintiff Does Not Raise a Genuine Issue of Material Fact as to Whether Defendant's Reason is Pretextual
Plaintiff does not raise a genuine issue of fact because there is insufficient evidence from [*53]  which a reasonable trier of fact could find that discrimination was the real reason for her "Inconsistent" rating. See James v. N.Y. Racing Ass'n, 233 F.3d 149, 157 (2d Cir. 2000).

a. Plaintiff's Poor Performance
Plaintiff's "Inconsistent" rating is supported by the evidence—in particular, her undisputed poor performance during 2014. As the word "Inconsistent" makes clear, an individual who receives this rating may have performed well in some areas or at some times, but performed poorly in other areas or at other times. An "Inconsistent" individual's performance is varied. Plaintiff admits that she made errors, and so, that her performance was, at minimum, varied. It is of no moment that she performed well at times. She also performed poorly at times—she prepared fewer reports, she made mistakes in reports she prepared. Her performance was not consistent. That surely justifies an "Inconsistent" rating.
Plaintiff disagrees with Defendant's description of her errors and the number of errors attributed to her. She specifically disagrees about who was at fault for errors in one particular third-quarter impairment form, and whether a WAC form she submitted was actually incorrect as alleged.
Yet, she has not offered any evidence to back up her unsupported [*54]  and conclusory allegations that overall, the classification of her poor performance as "Inconsistent" was inaccurate or exaggerated. To the contrary, the undisputed evidence demonstrates that Plaintiff made mistakes on important documents and that she admitted to these mistakes, multiple times. Moreover, there is no evidence that Defendant would not normally award an "Inconsistent" rating for the type of mistakes Plaintiff admittedly made; rather, the evidence suggests that Defendant does give such ratings when employees make repeated errors.
The 360 feedback from DePaolo further supports that Plaintiff's performance was substandard. (Warshaw Decl. Ex. LL.) DePaolo observed that with "issues that have been assigned to [Plaintiff's] ownership . . . the remediation drags on," and that there could be a "stronger push to drive positive results and outcomes for the team." (Id.) DePaolo also described Plaintiff's poor attitude and communication skills, particularly with respect to her supervisors. DePaolo wrote that Plaintiff "often puts down the leadership and practices across" her group and that this "causes a toxic environment within a team and for whoever works alongside her." (Id.) She [*55]  explained that "I have been in numerous meetings with [Plaintiff] and been the receiver of her emails and they often come across as combative and negative." (Id.)
Plaintiff claims that Defendant's reliance on DePaolo's evaluation is problematic because DePaolo's review was solicited by Crifasi, not by Plaintiff. Even assuming that to be true—Plaintiff testified at her deposition that she, not Crifasi, solicited the review from DePaolo and during his deposition Crifasi said that he did, (Def.'s Reply 56.1 at ¶ 384)3—and viewing the evidence in favor of Plaintiff, nothing in the record suggests that there was any collusion to generate or intention to seek out a negative rating. Crifasi reached out to DePaolo because she "had interactions with [Plaintiff] directly." (Crifasi Dep. Tr. at 212:1-6.) He testified without rebuttal that he did not discuss DePaolo's evaluation of Plaintiff with DePaolo until after it was submitted, so there is no evidence that he caused DePaolo to criticize Plaintiff. (Id.) It is perfectly reasonable for a supervisor to seek out a third-party opinion.
Furthermore, the fact that the other two 360 feedback reviews were generally positive does not, as Plaintiff suggests, [*56]  lead to the assumption that Defendant's use of DePaolo's comments as one factor in drafting the appraisal was discriminatory. This is particularly true since the other two reviews were solicited by Plaintiff herself and she was copied on one when it was submitted.
As further evidence of the issues with Plaintiff's attitude, Defendant points to an interaction between Crifasi and Plaintiff, when Plaintiff stated "F*** you" at the end of a phone call with Crifasi. Crifasi immediately called Plaintiff back and asked if she had been speaking to him. She responded no. Plaintiff claims that she thought she had ended the call when she cursed, and that this statement was made to herself while reviewing an email from a difficult client. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 87.)
Regardless of whether Plaintiff did or did not mean to aim her comment at Crifasi, she herself admits that she exhibited poor communication skills towards Crifasi. Indeed, the next day she sent an email to her coworker that she had "handled Frank [Crifasi] poorly." (Def.'s Reply 56.1 at ¶ 89.) Crifasi also confirmed to HR that Plaintiff exhibited a poor attitude towards him on multiple occasions. (Warshaw Ex. V; Clark Ex. 22.) Defendant [*57]  is correct that this evidence provides further support for the performance review's description of Plaintiff's communication skills as "disappointing" and that her attitude resulted in "negative reactions by senior management." (Warshaw Decl. Ex. MM.)

b. Crifasi's Treatment of Plaintiff
Despite evidence of Plaintiff's mistakes and poor communication skills, which Plaintiff has essentially admitted to, Plaintiff still claims that the "Inconsistent" rating was actually driven by Crifasi's animus toward her because of her medical condition. But, Plaintiff points to no evidence in the record that Crifasi ever exhibited animus towards her because of her disability.
Plaintiff claims that Crifasi exhibited animus explicitly connected to her medical conditions. She testified that she "believes" that Crifasi was nasty towards her because of her medical condition, but she did not back up her belief with evidence that connects any of Crifasi's behavior to her medical conditions. Indeed, she testified that Crifasi never referenced her medical condition when he was allegedly nasty towards her. (Def's 56.1 at ¶ 267.)
Plaintiff suggests that Crifasi expressed "annoyance" with any new medical issues she [*58]  had. She points to two emails as evidence. In the first email, Crifasi asked whether Plaintiff was having "health problems again." (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶¶ 368-369.) In the second email, he wrote "Unbelievable" upon learning that Plaintiff had slipped on ice and hurt her knee. (Id. at ¶¶ 370-371.) A plain reading of these statements simply does not support an inference of disability discrimination.
Plaintiff also contends that Crifasi was frustrated with her for not taking additional leave and for returning to work while she was still undergoing treatment. She claims he responded to errors she made during February 2014 by saying, "If you're not healthy enough you shouldn't be here." Assuming this to be true (Crifasi denies making the statement, but for purposes of this motion I will assume that it was made), it is not evidence of disability discrimination. Plaintiff was entitled to additional medical leave and her employer was entitled to an employee who was healthy enough to perform the essential functions of her job without making repeated errors.
It is true that a policy requiring a plaintiff to be 100% healed before returning to work—in essence, a policy that forbids an employee from [*59]  returning to work until s/he can work without restrictions—would violate the ADA. See Warmsley v. MTA N.Y. City Transit Auth., 308 F. Supp. 2d 114, 122 (E.D.N.Y. 2004) (collecting cases); EEOC v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc., No. 98 Civ. 2270(THK), 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16826, 2002 WL 31011859, at *20 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2002). But there is no evidence that Defendant had any such policy.
An employer cannot require an employee who can perform her job with reasonable accommodations to stay out of work until she is 100% healthy. But the ADA does not excuse poor performance or give disabled employees a free pass to perform substandard work. The evidence demonstrates that Defendant's policy was that an employee who was eligible for medical leave had to be able to perform the essential functions of her job, with or without accommodation, in order to return to work. Barrett testified that she told Plaintiff that if she were at work and not on leave, she would be expected to work "at capacity," which meant that Plaintiff would be expected to produce the same quality work as anyone else, and that she would have to "meet expectations." (Warshaw Decl. Ex. HH at 51:16-52:1.) That policy does not prohibit accommodations, so it is not inconsistent with the ADA or the NYSHRL—statutes that do not require an employer to tolerate mistakes or substandard work from a disabled employee. It differs from a "no restrictions" [*60]  policy (i.e., one that does not permit accommodation), or a requirement that Plaintiff be "100% healed." Warmsley, 308 F. Supp. 2d at 122. Plaintiff has not produced any policy or documentation from Defendant to support the existence of a "no restrictions" or "100% healed" policy. To the extent that Plaintiff argues that Crifasi or Barrett demanded that she be at "100%" before coming back, she fails to raise a genuine issue of fact. The only relevant testimony—aside from Plaintiff's—that uses the words "100%" came from Lyons, but Lyons could not say with certainty that Crifasi actually used that phrase; he only "believe[d]" that Crifasi did "at one point" say the words to the effect of "if Jacobson was not a hundred percent healthy, she should have taken more time off." (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 84.) "Believing" that something might have happened does not suffice to raise a genuine issue of fact—especially where, as here, Crifasi emphatically denies ever using the phrase " 100%." Plaintiff also testified that Barrett, the HR representative, used the phrase 100%—as in "if you are working during chemotherapy you are working at 100 percent." But Barrett testified that she said that Plaintiff should have been working "at [*61]  capacity," which would be to "produce the same quality work as anyone else would be expected to do," and "meet expectations." (Warshaw Deck Ex. HH at 51:16-52:1.) Plaintiff's assertion that she was told to return to work at "one hundred percent" is not on its own sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant had a policy that violated the ADA or NYSHRL—especially where, as here, Plaintiff does not dispute that (1) she was permitted to return to work when she believed she was ready, (2) she was granted accommodations when they were requested, and (3) she was provided additional support when she made errors. See Carey v. Cty. of Albany, No. 114CV420GLSCFH, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98526, 2016 WL 4098598, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. July 28, 2016) (plaintiff's own testimony that he was told to return to work "one hundred percent" is insufficient on its own to create genuine issue of material fact); see also Dep't of Fair Employment & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 747 (9th Cir. 2011) (evidence that Defendant informed plaintiff's wife that plaintiff "must be one-hundred percent to return to gainful employment" did not raise genuine issue of material fact when Defendant attempted to accommodate plaintiff by assessing his abilities on an individual basis).
Plaintiff testified that she returned to work when she was no longer [*62]  in pain. But she could not perform at the expected level—apparently due to the aftereffects of her chemotherapy. She made mistakes. She never asked for any accommodation but her employer never chastised her for completing as much work as her coworkers did (i.e., the employer gave her a de facto accommodation by accepting less work from Plaintiff than other employees). Her boss, Crifasi, told Plaintiff that she should take or ask for more time off if she needed to, but the totality of the circumstances does not imply any requirement that Plaintiff be "fully healed" before returning to work, or suggest any sort of discrimination on the basis of disability.
Plaintiff also argues that she has raised a genuine issue of material fact about whether the "Inconsistent" rating was based on Crifasi's animus. Plaintiff alleges that Crifasi purposefully drafted an overbroad coaching plan—one that made it seem like her performance was problematic before her disability— in order to cover up the fact that by instituting the plan, he was really penalizing her for having a disability.
The text of the coaching plan refutes her allegation. The plan was focused on Plaintiff's performance in early 2014, and [*63]  specifically references Plaintiff's errors in her most recent reports. The language of the plan does not demonstrate that it was the result of anything but Plaintiff's failure to perform in 2014. (See Warshaw Decl. Ex. Y.)
Further, although Plaintiff argues that the plan was not implemented as intended (which allegedly evidences animus), she offers no evidence in support of that argument. Plaintiff asserts that, while she fully complied with the coaching plan, Crifasi did not follow through with or prioritize his obligations to give feedback under the plan or provide her with "guidance." But, the evidence, including Plaintiff's own testimony (which she cannot now recount in order to create a genuine issue of fact), undermines Plaintiff's argument. Plaintiff herself agrees that Crifasi and Lyons had weekly calls with her to discuss her projects, which was their obligation under the plan. (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 358; Warshaw Decl. Ex. Y.) Plaintiff testified that these calls mainly entailed her describing her work, and that Crifasi had "little to add," but this is consistent with Crifasi's testimony that Plaintiff showed signs of the improvement after the plan, and that she suffered no [*64]  consequences as a direct result of being placed on the plan. Plaintiff complains that Crifasi refused to put this in writing but nothing in the terms of the plan itself required him to do so. The fact that Plaintiff would have preferred additional guidance or written feedback is insufficient to raise an issue of material fact about Crifasi's intentions.
Moreover, the evidence demonstrates that Crifasi treated Lyons and Plaintiff identically in connection with their 2014 appraisal rating. Crifasi had discussions with his supervisor, Meagher, and reviewed the company's rubric to determine where Plaintiff and Lyons best fit. Indeed, the record with respect to the 2014 rating actually undermines an assumption of animus by Crifasi because Crifasi initially suggested that Plaintiff and Lyons get "Strong" ratings, albeit at the low end of the rating. It was not until talking with Meagher and reviewing the guidelines again that he decided an "Inconsistent" rating was appropriate. (Warshaw Decl. Ex. OO.)

c. Lyons' and Crifasi's "Disagreement"
Plaintiff also argues that the fact that Lyons and Crifasi had different views of her performance raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Crifasi's [*65]  assessment was truthful or based on discriminatory animus. This is wrong.
Lyons testified that he would have provided Plaintiff with a "Strong" rating, but that Crifasi determined that she should be rated "Inconsistent" and directed Lyons to draft an appraisal that would support this rating. (Def.'s Reply 56.1 at ¶¶ 374-375.) At the time, while discussing Plaintiff's appraisal with HR, Lyons said that Crifasi "was not happy with [Plaintiff] so now we're trying to support it w/ facts." (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 at ¶ 413.) Then, when it came time to draft a second coaching plan for Plaintiff, which was responsive to her "Inconsistent" rating, Lyons disagreed with statements drafted by HR; he thought they were too harsh and did not adequately reflect Plaintiff's behavior. (Clark Decl. Ex. 29.)
There is no question that Lyons and Crifasi disagreed about Plaintiff's 2014 rating. But at this third McDonnell Douglas stage, Plaintiff must offer evidence that Crifasi was motivated to reduce Plaintiff's rating because of her illness, as opposed to because of what the undisputed evidences demonstrates was her admittedly inconsistent performance. She offers no such evidence. Her "ipse dixit" reasoning—"I [*66]  was disabled, they gave me an "Inconsistent" rating, therefore they must have given me that rating because I was disabled"—does not suffice to raise a genuine issue of fact in any case, see, e.g., Robinson v. Macy's, No. 14-CV-4937 CM, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173615, 2014 WL 6997598, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2014), and especially not in this case, where Plaintiff's performance problems are undisputed.
Moreover, when Barrett spoke with Lyons and Crifasi about Plaintiff's rating, Lyons confirmed that Plaintiff had made errors and developed a poor attitude during the 2014 year. (Warshaw Decl. Ex. WW.) Plaintiff suggests that Lyons' statements in this meeting are unreliable because Crifasi was present—she contends that even if Lyons disagreed with Crifasi, he would not have expressed that in Crifasi's presence. Plaintiff supports this with evidence that Lyons said to Moran during an earlier meeting, "Between you and me b/c Frank is my boss," before telling Moran that Crifasi's issues with Plaintiff largely stemmed from her attitude.
Lyons' statement to Moran does not lead to the inference that because Crifasi was present when Lyons spoke to Barrett, he was not truthful. Lyons' statements to Barrett are consistent with the undisputed fact that Plaintiff did make errors and did have an attitude problem during [*67]  2014. The fact that he made this statement during a meeting when Crifasi was present does not, without any additional evidence that Lyons disagreed with Crifasi about these particular facts, suggest that Lyons was not being honest—especially considering that the record demonstrates that when Lyons did disagree with Crifasi and HR about descriptions of Plaintiff's performance (while drafting Plaintiff's coaching plan, for example), he raised the issue.

d. Lyons' Initial Evaluation
Plaintiff claims that Defendant's removal of any mention of her cancer treatment from her "Inconsistent" rating and appraisal is evidence that Defendant was attempting to cover up discriminatory animus.
We start with the law. Illness may be the reason for poor job performance, but the law does not say that illness excuses poor job performance or requires an employer to accept poor job performance. The law makes it clear that an employee—even a disabled employee—must be able to perform the essential functions of her job, and to do so in a satisfactory manner. See Fink v N.Y.C. Dep't of Pers., 53 F.3d 565, 567 (2d Cir. 1995). The employer must provide a disabled employee with reasonable accommodation if that would allow her to perform her job in a satisfactory way, but if [*68]  a disabled employee refuses to ask for any accommodation, the employer is entitled to judge her on the basis of her performance—and if that performance would be unacceptable from any employee, to take appropriate action. Put otherwise, the law does not give disabled employees a free pass to perform at a substandard level without suffering consequences.
When Lyons initially drafted Plaintiff's performance appraisal, he connected Plaintiff's poor performance with the effects of her cancer treatment. Doing so did not violate any law.
When Crifasi and HR then told Lyons to remove references to Plaintiff's treatment in her performance appraisal, it was not because they were covering up the fact that she was a victim of discrimination, but rather because Human Resources departments everywhere, tainted by fear of lawsuits like this one, are prone to sanitize employment records so that there is no mention in them of any disability. But, it does not follow that they are covering up discrimination. Plaintiff herself admits that she performed at a substandard level—she made mistakes and she acknowledged that she did so—because she declined to take additional medical leave and continued to work [*69]  while the effects of her chemotherapy were still affecting her performance. Lyons was right—Plaintiffs errors were connected to her disability, and HR's effort to remove that fact from the review was a misguided. But there is no evidence that Plaintiff was penalized because she was disabled, as opposed to because she made mistakes. Therefore, there is no evidence that HR's cautionary directive was a cover for discrimination.

e. The HR Investigation
Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's investigation of her HR complaint was inadequate and intended to cover-up discrimination.
Where "a plaintiff can point to evidence closely tied to the adverse employment action that could reasonably be interpreted as indicating that discrimination drove the decision, an arguably insufficient investigation may support an inference of discriminatory intent." Sassaman v. Gamache, 566 F.3d 307, 315 (2d Cir. 2009). That is clearly not the case here. Not only is there no evidence that could be reasonably interpreted as indicating that discrimination drove the decision, there is also no basis to find that the investigation was insufficient. Barrett relied on (1) HR records, (2) documentation provided by Plaintiff, and (3) a conversation with Lyons and Crifasi [*70]  to conclude that Plaintiff was not treated unfairly. Defendant had no obligation to review additional documentation, interview additional individuals, or interview Lyons and Crifasi separately in order to investigate Plaintiff's claims.
Plaintiff was undoubtedly frustrated by her experiences in the early months of 2014. She felt that she was treated unfairly. She expressed to a colleague that, "I don't think I have it in me to forgive this treatment." (Warshaw Decl. Ex. T).
However, it is undisputed that she chose to come to work at a time when, she now admits, she should have accepted her employer's offer of additional leave. And, she refused to ask for any accommodation. That was brave and loyal of Plaintiff, but it does not excuse the documented fall-off in her work performance. The undisputed—the admitted—facts demonstrated that Plaintiff performed inconsistently during period from December 2013 through January 2014—doing some things well while making quite a few mistakes in others. She got an "Inconsistent" rating for what the undisputed facts show to be her inconsistent performance. The fact that her inconsistent performance was believed by all to result from her illness and treatment [*71]  is also undisputed. But that does not render her rating the product of discrimination. Rather, her rating accurately reflected her performance. When rating and performance are aligned, there is no discrimination.
Defendant is entitled to summary judgment dismissing this claim.

2. The Taxi Group Position
Plaintiff also alleges that she was subjected to an adverse employment action as a result of her disability when she was denied the Director position in the Taxi group. The position would have been a promotion in title for Plaintiff. The denial of a promotion in title is an adverse employment action. See, e.g., Treglia v. Town of Manlius, 313 F.3d 713, 720 (2d Cir. 2002).

i. Defendant's Legitimate Nondiscriminatory Reason
Defendant provides the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason that the two individuals chosen for the Taxi group positions were better qualified than Plaintiff. Defendant relies on the facts that the hired individuals had high reviews, good recommendations, and degrees that were useful to the group. Defendant argues that these qualifications were superior to Plaintiff's because she did not receive a high rating or recommendation and had limited experience in the taxi industry.

ii. Plaintiff Does Not Raise a Genuine Issue of Material [*72]  Fact as to Whether Defendant's Reason is Pretextual
Plaintiff relies on a theory of "cat's paw" liability to support her argument that she did not receive the Taxi group position because of her disability. Plaintiff claims that O'Gorman's decision not to hire her was based on the "Inconsistent" performance rating, which itself was the result of discrimination, so that O'Gorman's decision was "tainted" by the animus underlying the rating. She also contends that Crifasi, acting out of discrimination, purposefully and successfully influenced O'Gorman's decision by speaking directly with O'Gorman about the discriminatory "Inconsistent" rating he gave her.
The obvious flaw in Plaintiff's "cat's paw" argument is that she failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that the "Inconsistent" rating itself was the product of discrimination on the grounds of disability, as opposed to being an accurate reflection of her performance. A finding of discrimination is the necessary predicate for any "cat's paw" argument. See Campbell v. Nat'l Fuel Gas Distribution Corp., 252 F. Supp. 3d 205, 214-16 (W.D.N.Y. 2017), aff'd, 723 F. App'x 74 (2d Cir. 2018).
Even if there were some evidence that Plaintiff's "Inconsistent" rating was the product of disability discrimination, her "cat's paw" argument would fail. Under the [*73]  theory of "cat's paw" liability, O'Gorman must have negligently relied on Crifasi's animus, and this negligent reliance must have caused Plaintiff to suffer an adverse employment action. Vasquez v. Empress Ambulance Serv., Inc., 835 F.3d 267, 275-76 (2d Cir. 2016).4
But, there is no evidence that O'Gorman was negligent in relying on the "Inconsistent" rating. The evidence shows that O'Gorman learned about Plaintiff's "Inconsistent" rating from Meagher, one of Plaintiff's supervisors (but not the one who allegedly discriminated against her). During their conversation, Meagher also suggested that Plaintiff would not be good for the position. As a result, O'Gorman passed on her candidacy.
Reliance on an evaluation that was given as part of a company-wide process, which was told to O'Gorman by his supervisor, and supported by his supervisor's personal knowledge, is not negligence. As the Second Circuit has explained, "an employer who, non-negligently and in good faith, relies on a false and malign report of an employee who acted out of unlawful animus cannot, under this 'cat's paw' theory, be held accountable for or said to have been 'motivated' by the employee's animus." Id. at 275.
There is also no evidence that Crifasi "tainted" O'Gorman as a result of their [*74]  conversation about Plaintiff. O'Gorman testified that he spoke with Crifasi about Plaintiff. It is not clear whether this occurred prior or subsequent to his decision not to hire her, but I will, for argument's sake, assume that it was prior to the final decision. During their conversation, Crifasi recommended that O'Gorman not hire Plaintiff, given her rating and the mistakes she was making; there is no evidence that her cancer was so much as mentioned. Everything Crifasi said to O'Gorman was indisputably true—Plaintiff did make mistakes and she did get an "Inconsistent" rating. She has failed to raise any genuine issue of fact concerning discriminatory animus on Crifasi's part. Therefore, even if he were influenced by his conversation with Crifasi, I cannot conclude that O'Gorman made a decision tainted by discriminatory animus. See, e.g., Boston v. Taconic Eastchester Mgmt. LLC, No. 12 Civ. 4077 (ER), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135683, 2016 WL 5719751, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2016).
Accordingly, Plaintiff has not raised a genuine issue that O'Gorman's actions were tainted by an underlying act motivated by animus. See Staub v. Proctor Hosp., 562 U.S. 411, 422, 131 S. Ct. 1186, 179 L. Ed. 2d 144 (2011); Vasquez, 835 F. 3d at 272-73.
Furthermore, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that her credentials were so superior with respect to the individuals who were hired for the Taxi group position to give rise to an inference of [*75]  pretext.
In order to persuade a court that Defendant's reason is pretextual based on qualifications alone, without other evidence of discriminatory intent, Plaintiff's "credentials would have to be so superior to the credentials of the person selected for the job that no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have chosen the candidate selected over the plaintiff for the job in question." Walsh v. N.Y.C. Hous. Auth., 828 F.3d 70, 78 (2d Cir. 2016). Here, the two individuals hired for the positions, Mikhailov and Robinson, had strong credentials, including specialized professional degrees, strong recommendations, and relevant experience. Plaintiff, who lacked both their degrees and their relevant experiences, has nowhere demonstrated that her own credentials were "so superior" to these individuals to support an assumption that she was significantly more qualified. Moreover, unlike Mikhailov and Robinson, she did not have strong recommendations.
For these reasons, Plaintiff has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that the reason why she did not receive the Taxi group position was in fact pretextual. Thus, her adverse employment claim with respect to the Taxi group position fails, and Defendant is entitled to [*76]  summary judgment, dismissing this claim.

3. The Termination
In her final adverse employment action claim, Plaintiff alleges that she was fired because of her disability.
Termination is an adverse employment action. See, e.g., Galabya v. New York City Bd. of Educ, 202 F.3d 636, 640 (2d Cir. 2000).

i. Defendant's Legitimate Nondiscriminatory Reason
Defendant proffers a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason why Plaintiff was fired—she was let go as part of a Reduction In Force ("RIF"). A RIF is a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for termination." Delaney v. Bank of Am. Corp., 908 F. Supp. 2d 498, 509 (S.D.N.Y. 2012), aff'd, 766 F.3d 163 (2d Cir. 2014); see also Woroski v. Nashua Corp., 31 F.3d 105, 109 (2d Cir. 1994), abrogated on other grounds.

ii. Plaintiff Does Not Raise a Genuine Issue of Material Fact as to Whether Defendant's Reason is Pretextual
Plaintiff proffers no evidence suggesting that the RIF was pretextual.
Plaintiff first argues that the RIF, while it included her coworkers, was motivated by Defendant's intent to remove her in particular. She offers absolutely no evidence that supports her contentions.
It is undisputed that, starting in late 2014, the COEF group had less work to do and its portfolio had reduced in size. Plaintiff was aware that her group was downsizing. Defendant had been eliminating positions in the Special Assets group prior to 2014, and Plaintiff and members of her team were [*77]  requesting additional work.
Plaintiff argues that conversations between Meagher (notably, not Crifasi) and HR are evidence that the entire RIF was in fact motivated by the desire to remove her specifically—it is true that, in his initial conversation with HR about the RIF, Meagher discussed elimination of Plaintiff's job in particular. But the record is clear that this is not the only thing he discussed. HR records demonstrate that, in every meeting Meagher had with HR at which he raised the possibility of Plaintiff's termination, he also discussed funding issues for the COEF team and other potential job eliminations. In other words, Meagher's discussions of Plaintiff's termination always arose in the context of a broader RIF.
Additionally, other evidence demonstrates that the RIF was a legitimate business decision. A total of three jobs were eliminated—Plaintiff's and two others. Nobody was hired to fill Plaintiff's role, and her responsibilities were reassigned internally. See Woroski, 31 F.3d at 109.
Plaintiff next contends that her inclusion in the RIF was the result of discrimination. Again, she provides no evidence to support her argument.
Plaintiff argues that Defendant's choice to retain Brown, her colleague [*78]  in the COEF group, instead of Plaintiff is evidence of discrimination on the basis of her disability. Plaintiff points to the fact that Brown, who was both less experienced and not disabled, was transferred to another department rather than being fired.
But Defendant's decision to keep Brown is not evidence of discrimination against Plaintiff. As Defendant points out, Brown had administrative experience, was the lowest-compensated employee in the group, and had a "very strong" rating for 2014, when Plaintiff's undisputed performance matched her "Inconsistent" rating. Defendant made the business decision to move a lower paid worker with a versatile skill-set and no apparent record of poor performance to another team, rather than include her in the RIF. No evidence suggests that this decision was made because Plaintiff was disabled.
Plaintiff also claims that she would not have been included in the RIF if Crifasi had followed through on a statement that he would provide her with Middle Market work.
Plaintiff testified that, when she began working in the COEF group in 2013, her assignment was to be temporary. She says that Crifasi told her that, when the team was able to manage the volume [*79]  of the leasing work, she would begin to handle Middle Market accounts. Crifasi does not recall making such a statement. Plaintiff was never assigned Middle Market accounts and working on COEF accounts through her termination in June of 2015.
But even if Crifasi did tell Plaintiff he would provide her with Middle Market accounts, that without more is not enough on its own to raise a genuine issue as to disability discrimination. Plaintiff provides no evidence that she followed up with Crifasi about this particular statement. She also provides no evidence that there were accounts in Middle Markets on which she was qualified to work and to which that Crifasi could have assigned her. Plaintiff asked for more work more generally, but she admits that she was not the only one to do so—everyone on the team was making the same request, because the COEF profile had reduced in size and there was less for them to do.
Finally, to the extent that there was additional work available for Plaintiff (which the record does not support), Crifasi allegedly made his statement to Plaintiff when she was hired on the COEF team in 2013, which is prior to the admitted decline in her performance. Accordingly, it [*80]  would be reasonable for him to reevaluate reassignment given her performance.
For the reasons considered above, Plaintiff has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether her termination was pretextual. Summary judgment is granted for Defendant on these claims.

C. Failure to Accommodate
Plaintiff also raises a failure to accommodate claim under the ADA and NYSHRL. To make a prima facie case for discrimination under the failure to accommodate theory, a plaintiff must demonstrate:
(1) [P]laintiff is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ADA; (2) an employer covered by the statute had notice of [her] disability; (3) with reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job at issue; and (4) the employer has refused to make such accommodations.
McBride, 583 F.3d at 97 (quoting Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., Inc., 457 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir. 2006)).
Here, Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to satisfy the third and fourth elements of her prima facie case because she has not offered any evidence that Defendant failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation. I agree.

1. Plaintiff's Proposed Accommodation is Not Reasonable
An employer has an obligation to provide a disabled employee with a reasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. § 12112 (b)(5)(A). [*81]  Discrimination in violation of the ADA includes, inter alia, "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity." Id.; see also McBride, 583 F.3d at 96.
"The plaintiff bears the burdens of both production and persuasion as to the existence of some accommodation that would allow her to perform the essential functions of her employment. . ." McBride, 583 F.3d at 97. The plaintiff must "identify[] an accommodation, the costs of which, facially, do not clearly exceed its benefits." Kennedy v. Dresser Rand Co., 193 F.3d 120, 122 (2d Cir. 1999). This burden is "not a heavy one" but district courts may properly grant summary judgment when a plaintiff fails to meet it. Id.
A "reasonable accommodation" may include an adjustment in facilities, "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals [*82]  with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9). A "reasonable accommodation" does not entail eliminating the essential functions of the job or "having two workers perform[] tasks that one worker is assigned." Gilbert v. Frank, 949 F.2d 637, 644 (2d Cir. 1991).
The only accommodation that Plaintiff proposes is one of additional oversight. She testified that she should have received "closer review" of her work, and that Defendant should have worked with her to make sure her work was correct before it was handed in. (Def.'s 56.1 at ¶ 94.) I understand this to mean that Lyons should have personally redone Plaintiff's work to ensure it was accurate. Essentially, this accommodation would require Lyons to perform key aspects of Plaintiff's job, rather than trusting his direct report to do her own work.
Plaintiff's proposed "accommodation" is not reasonable as a matter of law. An employer does not have to require another employee to repeat work done by a person with disabilities, particularly when this would reduce overall productivity. See Gilbert, 949 F.2d at 644. Giving someone extra time to get something done is an "accommodation;" redoing work to be sure it was done correctly and checking it for errors is not.

2. Defendant Did Not Refuse to Make an Accommodation
It is generally the obligation [*83]  of the employee to inform the employer that an accommodation is necessary. See Graves, 457 F.3d at 184; see also Brady v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 531 F.3d 127, 135 (2d Cir. 2008). The employer does not have a duty to "spontaneously offer" additional accommodations. Nixon-Tinkelman v. NYC. Dep't of Health & Mental Hygiene, 434 Fed. Appx. 17, 19 (2d Cir. 2011).
Here, it is undisputed that Plaintiff did not ask for any accommodations whatsoever—not even the "close review" she discusses in her brief in opposition to Defendant's motion for summary judgment. Nevertheless, an employer may have a duty to accommodate, even if the employee does not request an accommodation, "if the disability is obvious—which is to say, if the employer knew or reasonably should have known that the employee was disabled." Brady, 531 F.3d at 135.
The ADA mandates an "interactive process" through which the employer and employee work together to "assess whether an employee's disability can be reasonably accommodated." Id. The employee must participate in the "interactive process" in order to help the employer identify the "precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." Monterroso v. Sullivan & Cromwell, LLP, 591 F. Supp. 2d 567, 579 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (citing Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations). If the employee chooses not to engage with the interactive process, the employer cannot be found to have [*84]  violated the ADA. "Liability for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation ensues only when the employer is responsible for a breakdown in that process." Goonan v. Fed. Reserve Bank of New York, 916 F. Supp. 2d 470, 480 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). "Courts must deny motions to dismiss or motions for summary judgment when presented with conflicting facts about the provenance of a breakdown . . . but in the absence of a factual dispute may grant such motions." Id. (internal citations removed.)
Plaintiff claims that Defendant should have recognized her need for an accommodation and engaged in the interactive process to explore additional accommodations for her disability. She argues that Lyons and Crifasi knew that the chemotherapy was causing side effects, including "chemo brain" and vision problems, but they did not suggest any accommodations or refer Plaintiff to HR. As Plaintiff explained in a letter to Barrett, "I was struggling. I asked for [Lyons and Crifasi's] understanding. I posed it in a general way as I hoped for a discussion as to how to make it work but they shut down any discussion." (Clark. Deck Ex. 35). She suggests that this was sufficient to put Defendant on notice that she required an accommodation and that Defendant therefore had an obligation to engage [*85]  in the interactive process to determine if such accommodation existed—even though she had not specifically asked for one.
Plaintiff has not raised a genuine issue or offered any evidence that Defendant failed to engage in the interactive process.
At the time of the alleged discrimination, Plaintiff and Defendant were already engaged in an interactive process with respect to her cancer treatment. Plaintiff knew how to request accommodations. She had been granted accommodations in the past, both for her current cancer treatment and for prior medical issues, was never denied accommodations, and she never received any suggestion that she would be denied accommodations.
The evidence demonstrates that Defendant encouraged Plaintiff to take advantage of the accommodations that were provided to her. For example, Lyons instructed her to "take it easy" when she was having reactions to her treatment. And, when Plaintiff was having difficulties performing, she was put on an informal coaching plan, with no adverse consequences, to provide her with additional support.
Of further importance, Defendant did try to initiate interaction about accommodations. It was rebuffed. In May 2014, HR followed up with [*86]  Plaintiff after she inquired about an accommodation form. Connie Southard, a Senior HR Associate, emailed Plaintiff and asked if she wanted an accommodation. Plaintiff said no. Having been turned down, Defendant had no obligation to go further.
The record demonstrates that every accommodation request that Plaintiff made with respect to her cancer treatment was granted. There is nothing in the record to suggest that she was denied an accommodation, or that she was ever asked to return from leave early. Defendant's HR records demonstrate that Defendant encouraged Plaintiff to take the time she needed. She refused to take it. The undisputed evidence is that Plaintiff's employer tried its best to get her to understand that she was not ready to return to work and unfailingly offered her medical leave as needed. Plaintiff's supervisors were concerned about her. They thought that she might be returning to work too soon, and they were supportive of Plaintiff, working with HR to ensure that she was taking sufficient leave and receiving appropriate accommodations to address her medical needs and following her doctor's orders. Plaintiff was the one who chose not to accept Defendant's assistance, [*87]  because of a misguided sense—unsupported by any evidence—that her career would suffer if she did. As it turned out, it was Plaintiff's decision not to accept or discuss accommodations, not Defendant's alleged failure to offer, that hurt her career.
Accordingly, because Plaintiff has not provided a reasonable accommodation, cannot establish that Defendant did not engage in an interactive process regarding her accommodation, and because Plaintiff was responsible for the breakdown in the interactive process, she has not established a prima facie case for her failure to accommodate claim. See, e.g., Julius v. Dep't of Human Res. Admin., No. 08 Civ. 3091 (PKC), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33259, 2010 WL 1253163, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2010).
Summary judgment is granted for the Defendant on this claim.

III. The Age Discrimination Claims
Counts Three and Four assert claims of age discrimination in violation of the ADEA and NYSHRL, respectively.

A. Legal Standard
The ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer "to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's age." 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). Like claims under the ADA, claims of age discrimination under the ADEA and NYSHRL are analyzed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting [*88]  framework. See Bucalo, 691 F.3d at 128-29 (ADEA); Bermudez v. City of N.Y., 783 F. Supp. 2d 560, 577 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (NYSHRL).
To meet the burden of the prima facie case in the ADEA context, the plaintiff "must show (1) that she was within the protected age group, (2) that she was qualified for the position, (3) that she experienced adverse employment action, and (4) that such action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination." Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 107 (2d Cir. 2010). A plaintiff may establish an inference of discrimination by demonstrating that she was similarly situated to other young employees in all material respects and was treated less favorably. See Ehrbar v. Forest Hills Hosp., 131 F. Supp. 3d 5, 21 (E.D.N.Y. 2015); see also Raspardo v. Carlone, 770 F.3d 97, 126 (2d Cir. 2014); Berube v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 348 F. App'x 684, 686 (2d Cir. 2009).
As I did in the context Plaintiff's ADA disability discrimination claims, I assume that Plaintiff has met her prima facie case and focus on the second and third steps of the McDonnell Douglas framework.

B. The Taxi Group Position
Plaintiff's first claim is that she did not receive the Taxi group position because of her age. Defendant does not address this claim directly in its papers because it asserts that "Plaintiff did not raise the transfer specifically in the age discrimination context." (Def.'s Reply Mem. of Law in Further Supp. of Its Mot. for Summ. J., at 8 n.4, Dkt. No. 52.) In fact, Plaintiff does address this claim [*89]  in the age discrimination context, albeit briefly, and I will as well.
I assume that Defendant would point to the same legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not hiring Plaintiff for the Taxi group position that was provided in the context of the ADA claims: the individuals hired were more qualified than Plaintiff.
As in the ADA context, Plaintiff has not raised a genuine issue that Defendant's stated reason is a pretext for age discrimination. Plaintiff asserts that she was more qualified than the individuals hired, but she cannot rely on this alone as she does not provide evidence that her credentials are "so superior" to the credentials of the individuals selected for the job that "no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have chosen the candidate selected over the plaintiff for the job in question." Walsh, 828 F.3d at 78 (2d Cir. 2016).
Plaintiff has made no allegations that Crifasi or anyone at Capital One ever made discriminatory statements based on her age, and she presents no other evidence that older workers are disfavored. In short, her argument boils down to: "I am older; younger people got a job I wanted; therefore, I must have lost out to them because of my age." Again, his kind [*90]  of "ipse dixit" reasoning is not sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact or to defend a motion for summary judgment. See, e.g., Robinson, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173615, 2014 WL 6997598, at *10.
Summary judgment is granted for the Defendant on this claim.

C. The Termination
Plaintiff also alleges she was fired because of her age.
"Even within the context of a legitimate reduction-in-force . . . an employer may not discharge an employee 'because' of his age." Carlton v. Mystic Transp., Inc., 202 F.3d 129, 136 (2d Cir. 2000); see also Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., Ltd. P'ship, 22 F.3d 1219, 1226 (2d Cir. 1994).
As in the ADA context, Defendant proffers that Plaintiff was terminated as part of a group-wide RIF, which is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. Plaintiff again relies on a comparison with Brown—the only member of the COEF team not terminated in the RIF—to prove pretext. Plaintiff asserts that the fact that Brown was not fired is evidence of age discrimination because Brown is three years younger than Plaintiff.
Initially, is not clear that Brown is an appropriate comparator. Employees' position and job responsibilities are relevant to determine if two employees are similarly situated. See Ehrbar, 131 F. Supp. 3d at 22. Brown had a different title than Plaintiff, received a lower salary than Plaintiff and had an administrative background.
But even if she were an appropriate comparator, the simple fact that [*91]  she was born three years before Plaintiff does not support an inference of discrimination, particularly in the context of a RIF. Brown is not a "significantly younger" than Plaintiff or other individuals included in the RIF. "In the age-discrimination context, . . . an inference [of discrimination] cannot be drawn from the replacement of one worker with another worker insignificantly younger." See O'Connor v. Consol. Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U.S. 308, 313, 116 S. Ct. 1307, 134 L. Ed. 2d 433 (1996). Brown was 58 at the time of the RIF. Plaintiff was 61, just three years older. This is not a significant difference. Both Plaintiff and Brown, as well as the rest of the COEF team, were in the protected age group under the ADEA. This further undermines an inference of discrimination. See Faldetta v. Lockheed Martin Corp., No. 98 Civ. 2614 (RCC), 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16216, 2000 WL 1682759, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 2000).
Plaintiff also does not provide any direct evidence of age discrimination. The only evidence that Plaintiff points to that Defendant was considering her age at all, in any context, is when HR Representative Moran made a note that Plaintiff was 60 when she was preparing background information for a meeting about Plaintiff's initial coaching plan. Moran's note was made in February 2015 in the context of a meeting unrelated to Plaintiff's termination.
Plaintiff suggests that Moran's simple act of recording [*92]  Plaintiff's age should lead to the negative inference that Defendant was considering Plaintiff's age against her in making its employment decisions. This attenuated assumption, without additional evidence, is not enough to raise a genuine issue of material fact that Plaintiff was chosen for the RIF because of her age.
Circumstantial evidence also weighs against a finding of age discrimination. Under the "same protected age group" inference, "where the plaintiff and the individual whose conduct is at issue are members of the same protected class, the inference that the conduct constitutes harassment or discrimination is weakened." Waters v. Gen. Bd. of Global Ministries, 769 F. Supp. 2d 545, 554 (S.D.N.Y.2011); see also Ehrbar, 131 F. Supp. at 25. Here, the individuals responsible for Plaintiff's termination were also in the protected age group. Meagher was born in 1956 and Crifasi was born in 1951.
Ultimately, Plaintiff has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether her inclusion in the RIF was pretextual. Summary judgment is granted for the Defendant on this claim.

IV. The Retaliation Claims
Counts Five, Six, Seven, and Eight assert retaliation claims under the ADA, ADEA, NYSHRL, and FMLA, respectively. Plaintiff withdrew her ADEA retaliation claim because she failed to [*93]  complain of age discrimination prior to the adverse actions. (Pl.'s Opp'n to the Mot. for Summ. Jud. at 23, Dkt. No. 46.)

A. Legal Standard
The ADA prohibits employers from retaliating against employees for requesting accommodations pursuant to the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. § 12203. Similar prohibitions are found in the NYSHRL and FMLA. See N.Y. Exec. Law § 296; 29 C.F.R. § 825.220 (c) ("The Act's prohibition against interference prohibits an employer from discriminating or retaliating against an employee or prospective employee for having exercised or attempted to exercise FMLA rights.").
Retaliation claims brought under the ADA, NYSHRL, and FMLA are all governed by the same McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework as discrimination claims. See Potenza v. City of New York, 365 F.3d 165, 168 (2d Cir. 2004) (FMLA); Nieblas-Love v. New York City Hous. Auth., 165 F. Supp. 3d 51, 74 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (ADA); Cowan v. City of Mount Vernon, 95 F. Supp. 3d 624, 651 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (NYSHRL).
To establish a prima facie case of ADA retaliation, a plaintiff must establish that: "(1) [s]he engaged in an activity protected by the ADA; (2) the employer was aware of this activity; (3) the employer took adverse employment action against [her]; and (4) a causal connection exists between the alleged adverse action and the protected activity." Monterroso, 591 F. Supp. 2d at 583.5 "To establish a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation, a plaintiff must establish that (1) he exercised rights protected under the FMLA, [*94]  (2) he was qualified for his position, (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, and (4) the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of retaliatory intent." Donnelly v. Greenburgh Cent. Sch. Dist. No. 7, 691 F.3d 134, 147 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal quotations and citation omitted). As with Plaintiff's ADA and ADEA claims, I will assume for the purposes of this motion that Plaintiff has established her prima facie case, and will focus on the second and third steps of the McDonnell Douglas framework.

B. The November 2013 Request for Leave and FMLA Leave Retaliation
Plaintiff claims she was retaliated against because she took medical leave, under the ADA for her surgery and then intermittently under the FMLA for her chemotherapy. She alleges that, after taking advantage of her leave, she was subjected to multiple adverse employment actions, including: being put on a coaching plan, removal of accounts from her portfolio, a poor rating, a reduced bonus and raise, failure to receive a promotion with respect to the taxi position, and her termination. Each of these constitutes an adverse action for the purposes of this claim.6
Defendant advances the same legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its employment [*95]  decisions with respect to the retaliation claim that it does for the ADA, ADEA and NYSHRL claims. This includes that: Plaintiff's poor performance justified the coaching plan, removal of accounts, "Inconsistent rating," and the rating's impact on Plaintiff's salary; Plaintiff did not receive the Taxi group position because the other individuals were more qualified; and, Plaintiff's termination was part of a RIF. Additionally, Defendant points out that Plaintiff's supervisors were consistently concerned about her health and encouraged Plaintiff to take time off from work to rest and recover as necessary. Defendant claims that this evidence further undermines Plaintiff's claims that Defendant retaliated against Plaintiff for doing just that.
For the reasons I have already discussed, Plaintiff has not met the burden of persuasion to establish that Defendant's legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for the adverse employment actions are pretextual. Moreover, with respect to the rating and termination, it is clear that Plaintiff was treated similarly to her colleagues—Lyons did not engage in protected action and also experienced these adverse employment actions. See Cuttler, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41906, 2012 WL 1003511, at *9.
Plaintiff's additional [*96]  argument that the temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse employment actions is evidence of retaliation is not enough on its own to support her burden of persuasion. While it "may give rise to an inference of retaliation for the purposes of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation . . ., without more . . temporal proximity is insufficient to satisfy [Plaintiff's] burden to bring forward some evidence of pretext." El Sayed v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 627 F.3d 931, 933 (2d Cir. 2010).
Plaintiff has absolutely no "more." In fact, the evidence is to the contrary. Plaintiff admits that her employer offered her additional leave and never complained about her medical situation. Defendant also tried to initiate a conversation about accommodations but was rebuffed. On the record before this Court, Defendant can best be described as a supportive employer that tried to help Plaintiff through a difficult illness, and that Plaintiff misguidedly resisted her employer's help.
Since Plaintiff has provided no evidence, other than the temporal connection, that these acts were retaliatory for her leave and not based on her performance, summary judgment is granted for the Defendant on this claim.

C. The March 2015 HR Complaint and the April [*97]  and May 2015 Attorney's Letters
Plaintiff next alleges that Defendant retailed against her for formally complaining to HR, both through the company's internal procedures and through counsel. First, she alleges Defendant retaliated against her for her March 2015 complaint to HR by denying her the Taxi group position and by terminating her. Second, she claims that Defendant retaliated against her for letters sent to Defendant by her counsel in April and May 2015 by terminating her.
Again, to the extent that she relies on her arguments from the ADA and ADEA context, Plaintiff does not establish a genuine dispute of material fact that Defendant's reasons for the denial of the Taxi group position or her termination are pretextual.
Furthermore, Plaintiff's arguments specific to her retaliation claims related to her Complaint and the letters also fail to meet this burden.
First, with respect to the Taxi group position, Plaintiff provides no evidence that O'Gorman was aware that Plaintiff made a complaint to HR, which is clearly necessary to establish that O'Gorman denied Plaintiff the position because of her complaint. See Richardson v. Bronx Lebanon Hosp., No. 11 Civ. 9095 KPF, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124465, 2014 WL 4386731, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 5, 2014). [*98]  Plaintiff argues that Crifasi knew about the complaint and that he spoke to O'Gorman about it. However, Plaintiff points to no evidence and relies on pure speculation that Crifasi discussed the complaint with O'Gorman. This speculation on its own is insufficient to meet Plaintiff's burden of persuasion.
Second, with respect to her termination, Plaintiff argues that the record demonstrates that HR was concerned about her termination appearing to be retaliatory for her complaint and the letter from her counsel—and that this in fact suggests that it was retaliatory.
Plaintiff points out that while Meagher and HR were working out the RIF, Barrett, the HR representative who had addressed Plaintiff's complaint, contacted and met with an outside attorney. Plaintiff claims that this further demonstrates that Defendant was concerned that if it simply terminated Plaintiff, it would be viewed as retaliatory and so instead, Defendant terminated her entire team.
As discussed previously, Plaintiff's termination was always considered in the context of a greater RIF, and Plaintiff has not raised sufficient evidence to demonstrate that she was terminated outside of a legitimate [*99]  reduction in force. Here, the additional evidence of Barrett's communication with an outside attorney does not change this analysis.
For these reasons, summary judgment is granted for the Defendant on this claim.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED. The Clerk of the Court is directed to remove Dkt. No. 42 from the Court's list of pending motions.
