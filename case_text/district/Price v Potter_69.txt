Opinion



OPINION AND ORDER
Pending before the court are two motions filed by the defendant, John E. Potter, Postmaster General of the United States Postal Service. On April 6, 2009, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment on the basis that the plaintiff, Lamarr A. Price, cannot prove a prima facie case of employment discrimination. Mr. Price did not file a response to this motion, and the time for filing a response has since passed. On April 28, 2009, the defendant filed a renewed motion to dismiss for lack of prosecution on the grounds that Mr. Price still has not complied with the defendant's discovery requests. As of the date of this order, Mr. Price has not filed a response to this motion.1 The court has reviewed the defendant's submissions and the record in the case and finds that a hearing is not necessary for the resolution of the issues presented. For the reasons [*2]  stated below, the court GRANTS the defendant's motion for summary judgment, and finds that the defendant's renewed motion to dismiss for lack of prosecution is MOOT.

Factual Background
Mr. Price failed to respond to the defendant's summary judgment motion or list the material facts he disputes, and therefore, the court will take the facts as provided by the defendant and supported by the evidence submitted by the defendant to be admitted. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2) ("When a motion for summary judgment is properly made and supported, an opposing party may not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own pleadings; rather, its response must — by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule — set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. If the opposing party does not so respond, summary judgment should, if appropriate, be entered against that party."); Eastern District of Virginia Local Civil Rule 56(B) ("In determining a motion for summary judgment, the Court may assume that facts identified by the moving party in its listing of material facts are admitted, unless such a fact is controverted in the statement of genuine issues filed in opposition to the motion.").
Mr. Price worked at the Postal Service for five [*3]  years before retiring due to disability on August 9, 2004. Mr. Price originally began as a mail carrier before being promoted to a Supervisor for Customer Service, the position he held when he retired in August 2004. In May 2004, Mr. Price had surgery on his back. Following his surgery, Mr. Price needed assistance taking care of himself and his girlfriend temporarily lived with Mr. Price after his surgery to take care of him. Mr. Price chose to take disability retirement in August 2004 because his sick leave had run out and he had not yet sufficiently recovered to be able to return to full duty at the Postal Service. In October or November 2004, Mr. Price's girlfriend moved out but still came over daily to help him out. By the summer of 2005, Mr. Price was able to fully care for himself and went back to college. In March 2006, Mr. Price completed his associate's degree in business administration at Tidewater Community College.
In November 2006, Mr. Price became aware of an open position for Supervisor for Customer Service that was being advertised within the Postal Service to its current employees. The position of Supervisor for Customer Service requires the ability to lift, reach, [*4]  deliver late arriving mail to employees on the street, and walk or ride with mail carrier employees to supervise them. According to Mr. Price, at this time he no longer had any medical restrictions that prevented him from performing the essential functions of a Supervisor for Customer Service. Mr. Price specifically testified in his own deposition that he: (1) had no restrictions on sitting; (2) could lift up to 24 pounds without restriction and could occasionally lift 24-35 pounds; (3) could carry up to 10 pounds and occasionally carry 11-24 pounds; (4) should not crawl, climb ladders, or work on uneven ground; (5) could crouch, squat, push/pull, climb stairs, lift above shoulder level, bend and kneel; and (6) had no restrictions on reaching above shoulder level, balancing, using his head and neck, or using his hands for repetitive actions or operating foot controls.
On November 17, 2006, Mr. Price emailed Barbara Pulling, Manager for Human Resources for the Richmond Division of the United States Postal Service informing her that he had been "forced" to retire because of his back surgery in 2004 but that he was ready to "come off of disability retirement status and return to full duty" [*5]  as a Supervisor for Customer Service. On November 29, 2006, Mr. Price had a telephone conference with Barbara Pulling, Jacob Cheeks, the District Manager for the Postal Service Operations for the Richmond Division, and Vivian Filhiol, Personnel Services Manager. Mr. Cheeks informed Mr. Price that he was not eligible to apply for the position of Supervisor for Customer Service because, at that time, that position had only been advertised internally within the Postal Service and was only open to current Postal Service employees. On December 1, 2006, Mr. Cheeks sent Mr. Price a letter confirming the substance of the November 29, 2006 phone conversation, and specifically: (1) advised Mr. Price of the information and procedure for applying for a craft position, which is a mail clerk or letter carrier position; (2) provided Mr. Price with information regarding re-employment for employees receiving disability benefits under the Federal Employees Retirement System; (3) informed Mr. Price that, in accordance with Handbook EL-312, Employment and Personnel, applicants for the position of Supervisor for Customer Service must be current career employees and have at least one year of continuous, [*6]  career postal service to be eligible to apply; and (4) informied Mr. Price that according to the Handbook EL-312, that when the office is unable to fill the vacancies internally after having expanded the area of consideration throughout the Postal Service, the office may use the external process for filling EAS vacancies. Mr. Price did not apply for the position of Supervisor for Customer Service or any other position with the Postal Service in 2006.
In either 2007 or 2008,2 the Postal Service changed their policy and began publically advertising supervisory positions without first advertising them internally. Norma Hutcheson, Agency Counsel for the Postal Service, wrote a letter to Mr. Price dated May 23, 2008, and advised him of the policy change, advised him of supervisory positions currently open in his area, encouraged him to apply for the vacant positions, and included an application to submit for the open supervisory positions. Mr. Price still did not apply for any positions with the Postal Service.
From September 2008 through January 2009, Mr. Price worked as a car salesmen at Priority Acura, and Mr. Price testified that he quit that job, not for medical reasons, but because car [*7]  sales were down and he was not earning enough money to justify working there. Mr. Price is also no longer seeking any health care providers for treatment for his back.
Mr. Price filed a timely administrative claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on the grounds that the Postal Service was engaged in illegal discrimination because the Postal Service would not allow him to apply for the internally advertised position of Supervisor for Customer Service because of his disability caused by his back surgery. On December 12, 2007, the Administrative Law Judge ruled in favor of the Postal Service on the grounds that even if Mr. Price were disabled, the Postal Service had no duty to consider a disabled applicant for any position other than those it considering non-disabled applicants for, and that there was no evidence of a discriminatory animus based upon disability on the part of the Postal Service.
On March 17, 2008, Mr. Price filed a complaint in this court alleging that the defendant discriminated against him because he is disabled. Mr. Price alleges that the defendant violated his rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), the Rehabilitation Act [*8]  of 1973 sec. 504 ("Rehabilitation Act"), the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), and Publication 316 - Reasonable Accommodation in the U.S. Postal Service3 by refusing to allow Mr. Price to apply for vacant job opportunities at the U.S. Postal Service that he was qualified to perform. On July 28, 2008, the court granted in part the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed Mr. Price's claims under Title VII and the ADA, leaving only Mr. Price's claim of employment discrimination in violation of the Rehabilitation Act pending. The court also ordered Mr. Price to file an amended complaint to include what relief he is seeking. On August 8, 2008, Mr. Price filed an amended complaint re-asserting his claim under the Rehabilitation Act and seeking the following relief: at least $100,000 in back pay, $300,000 in compensatory and punitive damages, $325,000 for negligent infliction of emotional distress, a choice of vacant assignments for Supervisor, Customer Service positions with the United States Postal Service within the Raleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina regions, compensation for relocation expenses, and the requirement that the Postal Service purchase his home [*9]  within one month after relocation should Mr. Price be unable to sell the home.
On January 29, 2009, the defendant filed its first motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute due to Mr. Price's continued refusal to be deposed and his failure to turn over required discovery. On February 11, 2009, the court ordered that Mr. Price had thirty days to be deposed and to comply with the discovery requests, and the court warned that failure to do so would result in a dismissal of his case.
On April 6, 2009, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. Mr. Price never responded to the motion and the time for doing so has passed. Subsequently, the defendant filed a renewed motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute on April 28, 2009 because of Mr. Price's continued failure to turn over requested discovery. As of the date of this Opinion and Order, Mr. Price has not responded to this motion. Trial in this matter is currently scheduled for June 9, 2009.

Standard of Review
Even though the motion is unopposed, the court will review the record to determine whether summary judgment is warranted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). Summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 is appropriate only [*10]  when the court, viewing the record as a whole and in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, determines that no genuine issues of material fact exist and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See e.g., Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-24, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-50, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Terry's Floor Fashions, Inc. v. Burlington Indus., Inc., 763 F.2d 604, 610 (4th Cir. 1985). The court must assess the evidence and draw all permissible inferences in the non-movant's favor. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). Nevertheless, the non-movant must make a sufficient evidentiary showing on each element of their claims such that a jury could reasonably find in their favor. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. While it is the movant's burden to show the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, Pulliam Investment Co., Inc. v. Cameo Properties, 810 F.2d 1282, 1286 (4th Cir. 1987), it is the non-moving party's burden to establish its existence. See Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986).
The non-moving party may survive a motion for summary judgment by producing "evidence from which a [fact finder] might return a verdict in [their] favor." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 257, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The evidence that the non-moving party presents to this end must be more than a "mere scintilla." Barwick v. Celotex Corp., 736 F.2d 946, 958-959 (4th Cir. 1984). In order for the non-moving party to survive summary judgment, they must present evidence that is "significantly probative." Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 327. If the evidence presented by the non-moving party is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment must be granted. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-250. District [*11]  courts have an "affirmative obligation . . . to prevent 'factually unsupported claims and defenses' from proceeding to trial." Felty v. Graves-Humphreys Co., 818 F.2d 1126, 1128 (4th Cir. 1987) (citing Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323-25).
When the motion is supported by affidavits, the non-moving party must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. See Cray Communications Inc. v. Novatel Computer Sys., Inc., 33 F.3d 390, 393-94 (4th Cir. 1994). The plaintiff, however, may not create an issue of fact by submitting an affidavit that is inconsistent with their prior deposition testimony. See Rohrbough v. Wyeth Labs., Inc., 916 F.2d 970, 975 (4th Cir. 1990).
Summary judgment does not require that no factual issues be in dispute. To find against the moving party, the court must find both that the facts in dispute are material and that the disputed issues are genuine. Only "facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under governing law" are material. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. A dispute over a material fact is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party." Id. Thus, Rule 56 mandates summary judgment against a party "who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322. Analysis
In an employment discrimination case, the plaintiff must first establish a prima [*12]  facie case of impermissible discrimination. Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, "the burden shifts to the defendant 'to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection.'" Id. at 253 (quoting McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)). Should the defendant satisfy its burden, then the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer's articulated reasons are a pretext for discrimination. Id. at 253.
The Rehabilitation Act "prohibit[s] an employer from discriminating against a 'qualified individual with a disability' because of that individual's disability." Shafer v. Preston Mem. Hoso. Corp, 107 F.3d 274, 276 (4th Cir. 1997); see also 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (Rehabilitation Act). To establish a prima facie case under the Rehabilitation Act, "the plaintiff must prove that: (1) [he] has a disability; (2) that [he] is otherwise qualified for the employment in question; and (3) that [he] was excluded from the employment or benefit due to discrimination solely on the basis of the disability." Shafer, 107 F.3d at 276; see also 29 U.S.C. § 706(8)(C)(i) (Rehabilitation Act). In this case, the defendant argues that Mr. Price has failed to meet his initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act because Mr. Price has failed to establish that he is disabled [*13]  as defined in the Rehabilitation Act, that he is otherwise qualified for the Supervisor of Customer Service position, or that he was discriminated against solely on the basis of the disability.
First, the court finds that Mr. Price failed to establish that he is disabled. "An individual is disabled under the . . . Rehabilitation Act if he or she: (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the individual's major life activities; (2) has a record of such an impairment; and (3) is regarded as having such an impairment." Davis v. Univ. of N.C., 263 F.3d 95, 99 (4th Cir. 2001); 29 U.S.C. § 794(a); 45 C.F.R. § 84.3(j)(1). Major life activities are defined as "functions such as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working." 45 C.F.R. § 84.2(j)(2)(ii); Davis, 263 F.3d at 99. "Substantially limits" is defined at being "unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform," or being "significantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity;" however, "[t]he [*14]  inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j).
Mr. Price had back surgery in May 2004 and could not take care of himself following surgery, and so his girlfriend moved in with him for a period of time. However, the record shows that by the summer of 2005 he was able to care for himself, and he went to college and earned his associate's degree in business administration in March 2006. Mr. Price stated that by November 2006, he no longer had any medical restrictions that would prevent him from performing the essential functions of a Supervisor for Customer Service. Mr. Price only asserted that he could not perform the functions of a mail carrier or craft position, but he testified in his deposition that he: (1) has no restrictions on sitting; (2) can lift up to 24 pounds without restriction and can occasionally lift 24-35 pounds; (3) can carry up to 10 pounds and occasionally carry 11-24 pounds; (4) should not crawl, climb ladders, or work on uneven ground; (5) can crouch, squat, push/pull, climb stairs, lift above shoulder level, bend and kneel; and (6) has no restrictions on reaching above his shoulder [*15]  level, balancing, using his head and neck, and using his hands for repetitive actions or operating foot controls. Even presuming that Mr. Price could not perform some of the functions of a craft position, as the court noted above, "[t]he inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j). Additionally, from September 2008 through January 2009, Mr. Price worked as a car salesman, and left that job due to financial reasons, not because of any medical reasons. Based upon the evidence in the record, the court finds that Mr. Price has not established that he has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of his major life activities. Thus, Mr. Price has failed to meet his burden of establishing that he is currently suffering from a disability, or that he was suffering from a disability, as defined by the Rehabilitation Act, at the time he first contacted the Postal Service in November 2006 to inquire about applying for the position of Supervisor for Customer Service.
The court finds that the record also shows that Mr. Price has failed to make a  case that he was discriminated [*16]  against by the Postal Service solely on the basis of his disability. First, Mr. Price never applied for any position with the Postal Service or had an application rejected by the Postal Service. Mr. Price only inquired with the Postal Service about applying for the position of Supervisor for Customer Service in November 2006, but at no point did Mr. Price ever submit an application to the Postal Service for that position or any other position. Second, the Postal Service informed him that pursuant to Postal Service policies in place in November 2006, Mr. Price was not eligible for consideration for the position of Supervisor for Customer Service at that time because he was not a current Postal Service employee. Finally, when the Postal Service changed its policy and allowed non-Postal Service employees to apply for supervisory positions, the Postal Service notified Mr. Price and invited him to apply, which he still did not do. The court finds that there is no evidence in the record indicating that the Postal Service's actions were in any way related to Mr. Price's back surgery. The record shows that the Postal Service informed Mr. Price that he would not be considered for the position [*17]  of Supervisor for Customer Service in November 2006 because he was not a current Postal Service employee, not because he had previously retired due to a disability caused by his back surgery. As Mr. Price has failed to make a prima facie case that he is disabled, or that he was excluded from employment with the Postal Service solely on the basis of his disability, the court finds that Mr. Price cannot met his initial burden of proof under the Rehabilitation Act.4

Conclusion
For the reasons stated above, the court GRANTS the defendant's motion for summary judgment as Mr. Price has failed to make a prima face case of discrimination pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act. Since the court is awarding judgment in favor of the defendant on his motion for summary judgment, the court finds that the defendant's renewed motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute is MOOT. The Clerk is DIRECTED to enter judgment in favor of the defendant.
The pro se plaintiff is ADVISED that he may appeal from this Final Order by forwarding a written notice of appeal to the Clerk of the United States District Court, United States Courthouse, 600 Granby Street, Norfolk, Virginia, 23510. Said written notice [*18]  must be received by the Clerk within sixty (60) days of the date of this Order. Fed. R. App. P. 3.1; 28 U.S.C. §§ 636(c)(4), (5).
The Clerk is REQUESTED to send a copy of this Opinion and Order to the pro se plaintiff and counsel for the defendant.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
