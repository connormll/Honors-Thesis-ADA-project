Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff, Jeffrey Andrews, alleges that his former employer, the Cobb County School District ("CCSD"), interfered with his ability to take medical leave and retaliated against him for doing so in violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq. (Compl. [1] Counts I-II). He also alleges that the CCSD discriminated against him based on his disability, failed to accommodate his disability, and retaliated against him for engaging in protected activity (i.e., requesting reasonable accommodation), all in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (Compl. Counts III, V-VI).
This matter is before the Court on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [35]. For the reasons explained below, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion be GRANTED.

I. STATEMENT OF FACTS
In support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, defendant as movant filed a Statement of Material Facts [35-1] ("DSMF"). See N.D. Ga. Civ. R. 56.1(B)(1). As required by Local Civil Rule 56.1(B)(2)(a), plaintiff [*2]  submitted a response to those proposed facts. (See Pl. Resp. to DSMF [38] ("PR-DSMF").) Further, as allowed by Local Civil Rule 56.1(B)(2)(b), plaintiff submitted a statement of additional material facts. (See Pl.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [39] ("PSUMF").) As required by Local Civil Rule 56.1(B)(3), defendant submitted a response. (See Def.'s Resp. to PSUMF [41] ("DR-PSUMF").)
The Court uses the parties' proposed facts and responses thereto under the following conventions. Where one side admits a proposed fact, the Court accepts it as undisputed for purposes of this Motion and cites only the proposed fact. Where one side denies a proposed fact, the Court reviews the record cited and determines whether a fact dispute exists. If the denial is without merit, and the record citation supports the proposed fact, then the Court deems it admitted and includes it herein. The Court sometimes modifies a proposed fact based on the record cited by the party or in the opposing party's response. Given the duplication between the parties' proposed facts, the Court sometimes includes one of them and uses a "see also" signal to the other. Finally, the Court excludes immaterial facts,1 includes some facts from its own review of the record, see [*3]  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3), and considers all proposed facts in light of the standards for summary judgment, set out infra Part II.

A. The Parties and Plaintiff's Job Duties
The CCSD is the second largest school system in the State of Georgia, and is responsible for educating more than 111,000 students in a diverse, constantly changing suburban environment, operating 112 unique schools and employing approximately 18,000 people. (DSMF ¶ 1.)
The CCSD originally hired Mr. Andrews in June 2015 as a custodian at Riverside Primary School. (DSMF ¶ 2; see also PSUMF ¶ 1.) On May 13, 2017, the CCSD promoted Mr. Andrews to Head Custodian II at Birney Elementary School. (DSMF ¶ 3; see also PSUMF ¶ 2.) The principal at Birney during the relevant time period was Monica Howard. (DSMF ¶ 16; see also PSUMF ¶ 6.)2
As a Head Custodian, the requisite physical activities included "walking, standing, kneeling, negotiating stairs and ladders," and "lift[ing] and transport[ing] 75 pounds over short distances." (DSMF ¶ 4.) Mr. Andrews's job duties as listed on the Head Custodian II job description included prompt and regular attendance; supervising the total custodial program of the school; ordering supplies and requesting equipment repairs [*4]  through the work order system; overseeing proper use and storage of all equipment and supplies; training subordinate staff on custodial procedures and equipment; performing minor maintenance as needed such as changing light bulbs in ceilings up to ten feet in height; maintaining understanding of custodial procedures and equipment; securing building as directed; inspecting assigned school building, related equipment and grounds for cleanliness, appearance and operating conditions; reporting areas of concern to principal; scheduling cleaning around extracurricular activities; cleaning entire building regardless of ceiling height; conducting monthly playground inspection for damaged or unsafe conditions; conducting monthly inspection of fire extinguishers; and performing other duties as assigned by the appropriate designee. (Id. ¶ 5.)
After reviewing the job description summarized above, Mr. Andrews testified he had to stand, walk around, and bend over in order to perform the duties listed therein, because "there's no job you can do sitting." (DSUMF ¶ 29, modified per record cited.)3 He added that his Head Custodian position required standing and walking around for the entire eight hours [*5]  of his workday, except for his thirty minute lunch break. (DSMF ¶ 6.) However, staff members may take breaks as needed. (PR-DSMF ¶ 6; see also PSUMF ¶ 17.)

B. CCSD's FMLA/ADA Policies
CCSD policy requires that an employee be able to perform all essential functions of his position before returning from FMLA leave, and an employee must submit a certification from his health care provider that he is able to resume work. (DSMF ¶ 37; see also PSUMF ¶¶ 20-21.)
CCSD policy states that if an employee requires an accommodation to perform the essential functions of his position, then it is the employee's duty to request the accommodation. If an accommodation is requested, the employee's request is handled by the CCSD's Support Services Department. (DSMF ¶ 38.)4

C. Plaintiff's December 17, 2018 FMLA Leave Request
Mr. Andrews requested FMLA leave on or about December 17, 2018 in order to have a surgical procedure that would place stents in his legs; he had this surgical procedure in January 2019. (DSMF ¶ 13.) Following this procedure, Mr. Andrews was cleared to return to work on February 4, 2019 without restrictions and returned on that date to his position as Head Custodian. (Id. ¶ 14.)5

 [*6] D. Interaction Between Principal Howard and Plaintiff
Plaintiff testified that before he had the aforementioned surgery, Ms. Howard had questioned him about his walk, and he explained that his gait was caused by the feeling in his foot. (Andrews Dep. [36-1] 63, cited in PSUMF ¶ 9.)
After his return to work from the surgery, Mr. Andrews informed Ms. Howard that the blockage had "healed" and that he would have to attend periodic follow-ups with his physician. (DSUMF ¶ 17; see also PSUMF ¶ 7, modified per record cited.) Ms. Howard testified that she did not observe anything out of the ordinary when plaintiff was walking, and that even though she noticed his limp, she did not believe it was unusual, and that she was not aware of plaintiff's formal diagnoses; on one occasion when he complained of foot pain, she gave him a card of a podiatrist she had seen. (Howard Dep. [36-3] 9-10, 22, cited in PSUMF ¶ 8 & DSMF ¶ 45.) She opined that Mr. Andrews had a "cool-type of walk." (Howard Dep. [36-3] 9.)

E. Plaintiff's September 16, 2019 FMLA Leave Request
Mr. Andrews requested additional FMLA leave because his physician wanted him to rest his feet to avoid having surgery on his bunions; accordingly, [*7]  plaintiff's school submitted his request for FMLA leave to the CCSD Human Resources Benefits Department on September 16, 2019. (DSMF ¶ 20; see also PSUMF ¶ 10, modified per record cited.) Mr. Andrews was allowed to begin his FMLA leave immediately on September 16, 2019, pending receipt of his supporting paperwork. (DSMF ¶ 21.)6
Despite submitting FMLA paperwork, plaintiff testified that he was "able to perform his duties at 100 percent" and "wasn't limited to not being able to do a job." (Andrews Dep. [36-1] 91, cited in PSAMF ¶ 16 & DSMF ¶ 44; see also id. at 101, asserting that he "was still able to perform my duties.") Mr. Andrews also testified that he "didn't have a problem with actually walking," that his condition (neuropathy) is "not a disability," that he "could walk," that he "can run," that when he obtained inserts for his shoes, "everything was great," and that his hyperkeratosis "never flared up." (DSMF ¶ 43.)7
On September 16, 2019, Jen Phillips in the Human Resources Benefits Department sent Mr. Andrews an email containing his FMLA leave paperwork, which stated that his "request for a leave of absence is currently under review," that all of the attached "paperwork [*8]  should be completed and returned to the Benefits Department within 15 days of this letter," and that Mr. Andrews's "leave is unapproved until documents listed in numbers 1 and 2 below are received by the Benefits Department." (DSMF ¶ 22.)8 Such documents included Request for Leave Form GARH-1, which had to be signed by his supervisor, as well as a Certification of Health Care Provider Form GBRIG-1, which had to be "completed by the physician and returned to the Benefits Department by 10/1/19." (Id. ¶ 23.)

F. Defendant's October 7, 2019 Letter to Plaintiff
Because the CCSD had not received the paperwork it required from Mr. Andrews by the October 1, 2019 deadline, it mailed a certified letter to him on October 7, 2019 stating that it had not received the required paperwork within fifteen days of its September 16, 2019 correspondence. (DSMF ¶ 24.) The letter of October 7, 2019 clarified that Mr. Andrews was on an unauthorized leave of absence given his failure to return the required paperwork, and stated that his file would be forwarded to the Employee Relations Department if the required paperwork was not received by October 14, 2019. (Id. ¶ 25.) Mr. Andrews received the October [*9]  7, 2019 letter. (Id. ¶ 26.)

G. Plaintiff's Submissions of October 11, 2019
Mr. Andrews submitted the required Request for Leave Form (GARH-1) on October 11, 2019. Although the Request for Leave Form provided September 13, 2019 as the start date for his leave, the "Date Requested Leave Ends" line was left blank. (DSMF ¶ 27.)9
Mr. Andrews's physician submitted the required Certification of Health Care Provider Form (GBRIG-1) on October 11, 2019, which stated that Mr. Andrews had hyperkeratosis on both feet, and that he would be "unable to stand for long periods of time" while the condition persisted. (DSMF ¶ 28; see also PSUMF ¶ 14.)10 Ms. Phillips did not contact this physician's office after receipt of the form. (PSUMF ¶ 24.)
Ms. Phillips telephoned Mr. Andrews on October 11, 2019 and left a message explaining that she needed an end date on his Request for Leave Form (GARH-1). (DSMF ¶ 30.) Ms. Phillips could not confirm that Mr. Andrews received her voicemail. (PR-DSMF ¶ 30.) Nevertheless, it is undisputed that Mr. Andrews did not submit an updated GARH-1 form containing an end date. (DSMF P 32.) In fact, CCSD did not receive any additional paperwork from Mr. Andrews. (Id. ¶ 35.) [*10] 

H. The October 14, 2019 Release to Return to Work Form
On October 14, 2019, Mr. Andrews's physician submitted a "Release to Return to Work" (Form GARH-8) clearing him to return to work without restrictions on November 13, 2019. (DSMF ¶ 33; see also PSUMF ¶ 25; Dowd Decl. Ex. K [35-3] 29-30.)11 Plaintiff's FMLA leave would be exhausted on October 25, 2019. (DSMF ¶ 34.) Although plaintiff testified that he believed he could have returned to work with restrictions before November 13 (PSUMF ¶ 22)), defendant would not allow him to return to work from FMLA leave with restrictions. (PSUMF ¶ 18.)
Ms. Phillips received the Release to Return to Work form and provided it to her supervisor; however, she did not communicate with plaintiff after she received it. (PSUMF ¶¶ 26-27.) Ms. Phillips also did not inform plaintiff that he could request a reasonable accommodation. (Id. ¶ 23.) However, the CCSD's policies regarding requesting a reasonable accommodation are available to all employees on its public website. (DR-PSUMF ¶ 23.) Moreover, employees are informed at hire that both the CCSD's employee handbook as well as other CCSD policies are posted on that website. Finally, plaintiff acknowledged [*11]  that he received and reviewed the CCSD's employee handbook upon his hire, and the acknowledgment that he executed pointed him to the public location of the handbook and other CCSD policies. (Id.)

I. CCSD's October 31, 2019 Letter to Plaintiff
On October 31, 2019, the CCSD sent Mr. Andrews a certified letter explaining that he had violated Administrative Rule GARH-R, Short-Term Leaves and Absences, by remaining out on unapproved leave, failing to submit necessary paperwork, and failing to report to work for twenty-seven consecutive workdays. (DSMF ¶ 40.) The CCSD's certified letter further stated that Mr. Andrews's actions constituted job abandonment, and that it considered him to have voluntarily resigned as of October 31, 2019. (Id. ¶ 41; see also PSUMF ¶ 28.)12 Mr. Andrews testified that he has no evidence that the CCSD considered his taking of FLMA leave in making its decision to terminate his employment. (DSMF ¶ 42.)13
Plaintiff asserts that he did not abandon his job; instead, the CCSD would not allow him to return following expiration of his FMLA leave. (PSUMF ¶¶ 29 30.) He also complains that no one from the CCSD contacted him to warn him that his employment was in jeopardy for not [*12]  returning to work earlier. (Id. ¶ 31.)
The CCSD has no record of Mr. Andrews ever requesting a reasonable accommodation, either between his return to work in February 2019 and his subsequent FMLA leave request on September 16, 2019, or before, during or after he began his second FMLA leave on September 16, 2019. (DSMF ¶ 36.)14 Indeed, the CCSD was unaware that Mr. Andrews maintained that he had an alleged disability within the meaning of the ADA. (Id. ¶ 46.)15
Plaintiff testified that he requested an accommodation of being allowed to sit down when his foot pain flared up. (PSAMF ¶ 15.) However, he does not say when he made this request or to whom it was made. (Id., citing Andrews Dep. [36-1] 78.) Plaintiff also supports PSAMF ¶ 15 with the assertion that the Certification of Health Care Provider form completed by his physician constituted a request for reasonable accommodation. (See Andrew Dep. [36-1] 95; see also note 14, supra.) However, he added that "I know I never, out of my mouth, asked for a chair." (DSMF ¶ 47.)

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
A "court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment [*13]  as a matter of law." See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of "informing the court of the basis for its motion and of identifying those materials that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Rice-Lamar v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 232 F.3d 836, 840 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). Those materials may include "depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). "Only when that burden has been met does the burden shift to the non-moving party to demonstrate that there is indeed a material issue of fact that precludes summary judgment." Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991).
The non-moving party is then required "to go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence "showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Generally, "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" supporting the non-movant's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). If in response the non-moving party does not sufficiently support an essential element of his case as to which he bears the burden of proof, summary judgment is appropriate. Rice-Lamar, 232 F.3d at 840. "In determining whether genuine issues of material [*14]  fact exist, [the Court] resolve[s] all ambiguities and draw[s] all justifiable inferences in favor of the non-moving party." Id. (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255).
In deciding a summary judgment motion, the court's function is not to resolve issues of material fact but rather to determine whether there are any such issues to be tried. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250. The applicable substantive law will identify those facts that are material. Id. at 248. Facts that are disputed, but which do not affect the outcome of the case, are not material and thus will not preclude the entry of summary judgment. Id. Genuine disputes are those in which "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. For factual issues to be "genuine," they must have a real basis in the record. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). When the record as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-movant, there is no "genuine issue for trial." Id. at 587.

III. DISCUSSION
Plaintiff makes claims for FMLA interference and retaliation, as well as claims of discrimination and retaliation under the ADA. The Court addresses the FMLA and ADA claims separately below.

A. FMLA Claims (Counts I and II)
Congress enacted the FMLA in part to address problems arising from "inadequate [*15]  job security for employees who have serious health conditions that prevent them from working for temporary periods." 29 U.S.C. § 2601(a)(4). Congress designed the Act to provide a balance between "entitl[ing] employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons" and "accomodat[ing] the legitimate interests of employers." Id. § 2601(b)(2)-(3). "The FMLA grants an eligible employee the right to take up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave annually for any one or more of several reasons, including '[b]ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.'" Hurlbert v. St. Mary's Health Care Sys., Inc., 439 F.3d 1286, 1293 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D)).
To preserve the availability of FMLA rights and to enforce them, the Act creates two types of claims: (1) interference claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer denied or otherwise interfered with his substantive rights under the Act, and (2) retaliation claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer discriminated against him because he engaged in activity protected by the Act. Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd. of Birmingham, 239 F.3d 1199, 1206 (11th Cir. 2001); see also 29 U.S.C. § 2615 (prohibiting employer from interference with FMLA rights). Plaintiff makes both types of claims here.

1. FMLA Interference (Count I)
Under the FMLA's anti-interference provision, it is [*16]  "unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under the [FMLA]." 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). To state an interference claim, "an employee need only demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to the benefit denied." Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1207; see also White v. Beltram Edge Tool Supply, Inc., 789 F.3d 1188, 1191 (11th Cir. 2015) ("An interference claim has two elements: (1) the employee was entitled to a benefit under the FMLA, and (2) her employer denied her that benefit.").
Defendant argues that summary judgment should be granted in its favor on the interference claim because (1) plaintiff was unable to perform the essential functions of his position after exhaustion of his FMLA leave; (2) plaintiff failed to complete all of his required FMLA paperwork within the fifteen-day deadline or subsequent extension; and (3) plaintiff received all the FMLA leave to which he was entitled. (Def.'s Br. [35-2] 9-13.)
Assuming arguendo that plaintiff submitted the paperwork necessary for the CCSD to approve his FMLA leave request, it is undisputed that, as of the date he left work, September 16, 2019, he had six weeks of FMLA leave remaining for the rolling year ending December 17, 2019. (DSMF ¶ 15.) It is further undisputed [*17]  that Mr. Andrews received all of that FMLA leave.
When that six weeks of FMLA leave expired on October 25, 2019, plaintiff had a right of restoration to his job. See Martin v. Brevard Cty. Pub. Sch., 543 F.3d 1261, 1267 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) ("An employee has the right following FMLA leave 'to be restored by the employer to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced.'") (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 2614(a)(1)(A)). However, there is an important caveat: "If the employee is unable to perform an essential function of the position because of a physical or mental condition, including the continuation of a serious health condition . . . the employee has no right to restoration to another position under the FMLA.'" Diaz v. Transatlantic Bank, 367 F. App'x 93, 95 (11th Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 825.216(c)).16
The information available to the CCSD at the time plaintiff exhausted his FMLA leave showed that (1) he had hyperkeratosis on both feet and would be "unable to stand for long periods of time" while the condition persisted (see DSMF ¶ 28, quoting Certification of Health Care Provider Form (GBRIG-1), received October 11, 2019); and (2) he could not return to work without restrictions until November 13, 2019. (See DSMF ¶ 33, citing "Release to Return to Work" (Form GARH-8), received October 14, 2019.) Because plaintiff's [*18]  position as a janitor required him to stand and walk for the entire eight hours of his workday (except for a 30-minute lunch break), and he could not perform his job duties while sitting, plaintiff could not perform an essential function of his position.
Given these undisputed facts, plaintiff has no interference claim because he received all the FMLA leave to which he was entitled. Giles v. Daytona State Coll., Inc., 542 F. App'x 869, 875 (11th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) ("The record confirms that Giles used all of her available FMLA leave on June 22, 2009, and thus, there is no evidence that she was denied an FMLA benefit to which she was entitled."); Edwards v. WellStar Med. Grp., LLC, No. 1:18-CV-4492-MHC-LTW, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 197210, 2020 WL 6293153, at *10 (N.D. Ga. May 15, 2020) ("Because the record establishes that Plaintiff used all of her FMLA leave prior to her termination on June 8, 2018, a reasonable jury could not find that Plaintiff was denied a benefit under the FMLA to which she was entitled."), R. & R. adopted, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 196960, 2020 WL 6156566 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 8, 2020); Odum v. Dolgencorp, LLC, No. 4:14-CV-0151-HLM, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 182860, 2015 WL 12697644, at *2 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 9, 2015) (adopting magistrate judge's recommendation that summary judgment be granted because plaintiff has no interference claim; he received all of the FMLA benefits to which he was entitled).
Moreover, given that plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of his position when he exhausted his FMLA leave, the CCSD did not interfere with his right to reinstatement. [*19]  See Jones v. Gulf Coast Health Care of Del., LLC, 854 F.3d 1261, 1268 (11th Cir. 2017) ("Relevant caselaw suggests that an employer does not interfere with an employee's right to reinstatement if that employee is terminated after taking leave in excess of the 12 weeks permitted by the FMLA."); see also Freeman v. Koch Foods of Ala., 777 F. Supp. 2d 1264, 1289 (M.D. Ala. 2011) ("[T]he right to reinstatement terminates once the twelve weeks of FMLA leave are finished."). Therefore, summary judgment should be entered for the CCSD on plaintiff's FMLA interference claim.17

2. FMLA Retaliation Claim (Count II)
To prove FMLA retaliation, plaintiff must show that the CCSD intentionally discriminated against him for exercising his right to medical leave. See 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2); 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c). Unlike an interference claim, an employee "bringing a retaliation claim faces the increased burden of showing that [her] employer's actions were motivated by an impermissible retaliatory or discriminatory animus." Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1207 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
In the absence of direct evidence supporting such a claim, courts apply the burden-shifting framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), for evaluating Title VII retaliatory discharge claims. Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 798 (2000). To establish a prima facie claim of retaliation under the FMLA, the plaintiff must show that (1) he engaged in statutorily protected conduct, (2) he suffered [*20]  a materially adverse action,18 and (3) there is a causal connection between the two. Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., 602 F.3d 1231, 1234 (11th Cir. 2010); see also Martin v. Brevard Cty. Public Schs., 543 F.3d 1261, 1268 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (FMLA retaliation claims assessed under McDonnell Douglas framework).
If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation under the McDonnell Douglas framework, then the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its action. If the defendant does so, then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to establish that the proffered reason was pretext for retaliation. Bartels v. S. Motors of Savannah, Inc., 681 F. App'x 834, 837-38 (11th Cir. 2017) (per curiam).
Plaintiff alleges that defendant terminated him in retaliation for requesting FMLA leave. (Compl. ¶ 56.). Because requesting and taking FMLA leave is protected activity, see Jones, 854 F.3d at 1271, plaintiff satisfied element one of his prima facie case.19 Plaintiff further contends (and it is undisputed) that he suffered an adverse employment action—termination. (Pl.'s Resp. [37] 9.) This satisfies element two. The question then is whether plaintiff has raised a triable issue over whether there is a causal connection between his protected activity and his termination (i.e., element three).
Plaintiff asserts that he has satisfied this burden because of the close temporal proximity between his request [*21]  for FMLA leave and his discharge. See Raspanti v. Four Amigos Travel, Inc., 266 F. App'x 820, 823 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (citation omitted). As the Circuit has explained, "[t]he causal connection element is satisfied if a plaintiff shows that the protected activity and adverse action were not wholly unrelated" and, "[g]enerally, a plaintiff can show the two events are not wholly unrelated if the plaintiff shows that the decision maker was aware of the protected conduct at the time of the adverse employment action." Krutzig, 602 F.3d at 1234 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Given that the decisionmaker here (Mr. Dowd) was obviously aware that plaintiff had sought on September 19, 2019 to take FMLA leave when he penned the October 31, 2019 certified letter notifying plaintiff of his termination, he has established a causal connection and thus a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation.
Because plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for plaintiff's termination. Jones, 854 F.3d at 1271 (citation omitted). However, that "burden is merely one of production; [defendant] need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons." Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). [*22] 
Defendant has met its burden by showing that it never considered plaintiff to be on FMLA leave because he failed to submit the necessary paperwork. Moreover, defendant shows that, even if plaintiff had submitted that paperwork, his physician submitted a Release to Return to Work form that did not clear him to return to work without restrictions until November 13, 2019, a date after his FMLA leave was exhausted. Given that plaintiff had exhausted his FMLA leave and he could not perform the essential functions of his position at that time, the case law discussed supra Part III.A.1 allowed CCSD to discharge plaintiff. The CCSD contends that it could not be retaliatory to terminate someone when that very action is lawful under the statute. Finally, defendant notes plaintiff's concession that he has no evidence that the CCSD considered that he had sought FMLA leave when it discharged him. These are all legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for discharging plaintiff. See Marks v. City of Atlanta, Ga., No. 1:05-CV-0079-CAP-AJB, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104914, 2007 WL 9700632, at *28 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 10, 2007) ("[A]n employee's failure to return to work following the expiration of FMLA leave is a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for terminating an employee."), R. & R. adopted sub nom. Marks v. City of Atlanta, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104913, 2007 WL 9700657 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 21, 2007).
Thus, the burden shifts back to plaintiff [*23]  to show that defendant's reasons are pretext for retaliation. To show pretext, plaintiff must "come forward with evidence, including the previously produced evidence establishing the prima facie case, sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision." Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1024 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover, plaintiff may not simply quarrel with the wisdom of defendant's reasons. Brooks v. Cty. Comm'n of Jefferson Cty., Ala., 446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir. 2006). Rather, plaintiff must demonstrate "such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
Plaintiff submits no probative evidence suggesting that his request for FMLA leave had anything to do with his discharge. In fact, he admitted in his deposition that he has no evidence connecting his request for FMLA leave to his discharge. Plaintiff also has no evidence to contradict defendant's reasonable belief (articulated in Mr. Dowd's certified termination letter of October 31, 2019) that he was [*24]  on an unauthorized and extended absence, given his failure to return the required FMLA documentation, that constituted job abandonment.
Moreover, even if plaintiff had submitted that requested documentation, plaintiff has pointed the Court to no probative evidence suggesting the CCSD's decision to terminate his employment at the expiration of his FMLA leave, when it is undisputed that he could not perform the essential functions of his job, was motivated by the fact that he has taken leave. Plaintiff had already taken one FMLA leave within the past year and had returned to work with no problems. There simply is nothing showing that the CCSD decided to terminate plaintiff because he had gone out of work a second time.20 Given the lack of evidence that the CCSD acted out of retaliatory animus, the undersigned recommends that summary judgment be entered against plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim.21

B. Plaintiff's ADA Claims
Plaintiff alleged that defendant (1) intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of his disability when it terminated him (Compl. Count III); (2) failed to accommodate his alleged disability (id. Count VI); and (3) retaliated [*25]  against him when he engaged in protected activity by requesting reasonable accommodation (id. Count V). However, in response to Defendant's Motion seeking entry of summary judgment on all three claims, plaintiff argued only the viability of his failure to accommodate and retaliation claims. (See Pl.'s Resp. [37] 12-19.) Therefore, plaintiff has abandoned the disability discrimination claim in Count III. See also Kramer v. Gwinnett Cty., Ga., 306 F. Supp. 2d 1219, 1221 (N.D. Ga.) ("[A] party's failure to respond to any portion or claim in a motion indicates such portion, claim or defense is unopposed."), aff'd, 116 F. App'x 253 (11th Cir. 2004) (table decision). Thus, the Court only addresses plaintiff's failure to accommodate and ADA retaliation claims below.

1. Failure to Accommodate (Count VI)
The ADA requires an employer to accommodate an employee with a known disability unless the accommodation would result in undue hardship to the employer. Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000) (per curiam). To prevail on a claim of disability discrimination based on an alleged failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he (1) is disabled;22 (2) was a "qualified individual"23 when he suffered the adverse employment action; and (3) was discriminated against because of his disability by being denied a reasonable accommodation [*26]  that would have allowed him to keep working. Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001).
With regard to the first element, a plaintiff must present evidence establishing that his employer had actual knowledge of his alleged disability or regarded him as disabled. Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1186 (11th Cir. 2005). The undisputed material facts here show that the CCSD did not have actual knowledge of plaintiff's claimed disability. There is also no evidence that it regarded him as disabled. Although plaintiff now claims that he was substantially limited in the major life activity of walking (Pl.'s Resp. Br. [37] 14), the record fails to substantiate that assertion. Indeed, plaintiff's testimony contradicts it. As noted supra, plaintiff testified that he "didn't have a problem with actually walking," that his condition (neuropathy) is "not a disability," that he "could walk," that he "can run," that when he obtained inserts for his shoes, "everything was great," and that his hyperkeratosis "never flared up." (DSMF ¶ 43.) Given that plaintiff submitted a Release to Return to Work with no restrictions as of November 13, 2019, it would have appeared to the CCSD that plaintiff was not disabled but had a temporary impairment that had been resolved. See Sutton v. Lader, 185 F.3d 1203, 1209 (11th Cir. 1999) ("A temporary inability to [*27]  work while recuperating from surgery is not such a permanent or long-term impairment and does not constitute evidence of a disability covered by the Act.").
Although plaintiff's failure to establish the first element could end the analysis, to provide a complete Report the Court looks to the third element as well. An employer's duty to provide a reasonable accommodation24 is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made. Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255-56 (emphasis added); see also Laun v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., No. CV 118-033, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 164517, 2019 WL 4694940, at *8 (S.D. Ga. Sept. 25, 2019) ("[T]he initial burden is on Plaintiff to show he made a sufficient request for a reasonable accommodation.").25 An employee makes an adequate request for a reasonable accommodation when it is sufficiently specific and reasonable. Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d at 1363-64 (11th Cir. 1999) (). "For a request to be sufficiently specific, it does not have to employ any magic words, but the request must be definite enough that under the circumstances, the employer can be said to know of both the disability and desire for an accommodation." Laun, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 164517, 2019 WL 4694940, at *9. "An employee's failure to request a reasonable accommodation is fatal to the prima facie case; 'the duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made.'" Warren v. Volusia Cty., Fla., 188 F. App'x 859, 863 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam) [*28]  (quoting Gaston, 167 F.3d at 1363).
The undisputed material facts again go against plaintiff. It is undisputed that Mr. Andrews made no request to the CCSD for a reasonable accommodation while out on the FMLA leave he potentially began on September 19, 2019.26 Instead, plaintiff contends that the CCSD should have known of his need for a reasonable accommodation from the Certification of Health Care Provider Form (GBRIG-1) that his physician submitted on October 11, 2019, which stated that he had hyperkeratosis on both feet, and that he would be "unable to stand for long periods of time" while the condition persisted. (DSMF ¶ 28.)
However, submission of that certification is insufficient to place the CCSD on notice that Mr. Andrew was requesting a reasonable accommodation when it did not know he was disabled. See Hamilton v. Schneider Nat'l Carriers, Inc., No. 1:17-CV-3264-MHC-JSA, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 235850, 2019 WL 11553744, at *17 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 24, 2019), R. & R. adopted, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 235836, 2019 WL 11553748 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 7, 2019) (submission of a physician's medical certifications setting out work restrictions insufficient to trigger employer's obligation to engage in the interactive process to determine whether a reasonable accommodation can be made in the absence of evidence it was aware that employee had a physical or mental impairment that could be considered a disability under [*29]  the ADA); see also Hunter v. Atlanta Pub. Schs., No. 1:18-CV-00869-JPB, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 257677, 2020 WL 10574760, at *5 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 28, 2020) (doctor's note, which stated that plaintiff was diagnosed with "Long Trigger" and that she was released for "Limited Duty" with a five-minute stretch break every hour "until [the] next scheduled appointment," was insufficient to show that APS was on notice that plaintiff had a disability under the ADA). In sum, because plaintiff fails to show that he was disabled or that he requested a reasonable accommodation, his ADA failure to accommodate claim fails as a matter of law.

2. ADA Retaliation (Count V)
Plaintiff alleges that defendant terminated him in retaliation for engaging in protected activity (i.e., requesting a reasonable accommodation). (Compl. Count V.) The ADA's anti-retaliation provision states that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a).
To prevail on his ADA retaliation claim, Mr. Andrews must establish each of the following elements of his prima facie [*30]  case: (1) he engaged in a statutorily protected expression, (2) he suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal link between the two. Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016).27 "The first element may be met by a request for a reasonable accommodation." Id.; see also Vaughan v. World Changers Church Int'l, Inc., 1:13-CV-0746-AT, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141912, 2014 WL 4978439, at *12 & n.10 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 16, 2014) (request for medical leave considered statutorily protected activity for purposes of ADA retaliation claim).
Plaintiff fails to satisfy the first element because, as already held, he did not engage in protected activity, i.e., he did not request a reasonable accommodation. See Stevenson v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., No. 1:16-CV-002571-AT-LTW, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124768, 2021 WL 2677018, at *16 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 12, 2021) (given that plaintiff failed to request reasonable accommodation, her ADA retaliation claim fails for failure to engage in statutorily protected activity); Jenks v. Naples Cmty. Hosp., Inc., 829 F. Supp. 2d 1235, 1253 (M.D. Fla. 2011) (FMLA documents which were approved by the defendant-employer did not constitute request for a reasonable accommodation). The Court need not address the other two prima facie elements given plaintiff's inability to establish the first one. See Turlington v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., 135 F.3d 1428, 1433 (11th Cir. 1998) ("[S]ummary judgment against the plaintiff is appropriate if he fails to satisfy any one of the elements of a prima facie case."). Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [*31]  be granted as to plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the reasons explained above, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [35] be GRANTED.
The Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference to the undersigned Magistrate Judge.
SO RECOMMENDED, this 28th day of October, 2021.
