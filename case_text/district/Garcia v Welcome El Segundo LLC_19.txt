CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL

Proceedings: IN CHAMBERS—ORDER RE DEFENDANT WELCOME EL SEGUNDO, LLC'S MOTION TO DISMISS [12]
On March 14, 2021, Defendant Welcome El Segundo, LLC filed a Motion to Dismiss ("MTD") Plaintiff Orlando Garcia's First Amended Complaint ("FAC") under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). [Doc. # 12.] The motion is fully briefed. [Doc. ## 13, 14.] For the reasons stated below, the Court GRANTS the MTD.

I.

JUDICIAL NOTICE
Defendant requests that the Court take judicial notice of exhibits in the following categories: (1) screenshots of the "Landing" page and "Accessibility" page of Defendant's website; (2) screenshots of pages from Defendant's website with accessible room descriptions; (3) a list of Plaintiff's other cases in federal court; (4) a copy of the Consent Decree in U.S. v. Hilton Worldwide, Inc., No. CV 10-1924 (D.D.C. Nov. 29, 2010) [*2]  [Doc. # 5]; (5) a copy of the Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss in Arroyo v. JWMFE Anaheim, LLC, No. SA CV 21-00014-CJC (KESx), 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51569 (C.D. Cal. February 16, 2021); (6) a screenshot of the "Accessibility" page from JWMFE Anaheim's website; (7) a copy of the Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss in Salinas v. Apple Ten SPE Capistrano, LLC., No. SA CV20-02379-CJC (DFMx), 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74210 (C.D. Cal. February 18, 2021); and (8) copy of the FAC in Garcia v. Gateway Hotel, L.P., No. CV 20-10752-PA (GJSx) (C.D. Cal. Dec. 30, 2020). [Doc # 12-2.]
On a motion to dismiss, a court may consider documents attached to the complaint, documents incorporated by reference in a complaint, or documents subject to judicial notice. U.S. v. Ritchie, 342 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir. 2003). Federal Rule of Evidence 201 permits courts to take judicial notice of factual material "(1) generally known within the court's territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned." Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). Additionally, courts may take notice of "matters of public record." Reyn's Pasta Bella, LLC. v. Visa USA, Inc., 442 F.3d 741,746 (9th Cir. 2006).
The Court takes judicial notice of Exhibits 1 and 2 because the FAC relies upon information found on Defendant's website, and [*3]  Garcia does not contest the accuracy of the screenshots. See Daniels-Hall v. National Educ. Ass'n, 629 F.3d 992, 998 (9th Cir. 2010) (finding the court correctly took judicial notice of information available on websites where "Plaintiffs directly quoted the material posted on these web pages, thereby incorporating them into the Complaint.").
Courts "may take judicial notice of 'matters of public record.'" Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 689 (9th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). Documents on file in federal or state courts are considered undisputed matters of public record. Harris v. County of Orange, 682 F.3d 1126, 1132 (9th Cir. 2012). Courts take notice of the existence of such filings, not the truth of the facts recited therein. Lee, 250 F.3d at 689-90. Moreover, the Court need not take judicial notice of case law or other court orders to be able to consider them.
Because the Court need not rely on the exhibits other than exhibits 1, 2, and 8, the Court DENIES as moot the remainder of the RJN. The Court also DENIES as moot Defendant's Supplemental RJN in support of its Reply. [Doc. # 14-1.]

II.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 1
Garcia suffers from cerebral palsy and physical disabilities which require use of a wheelchair, walker, or cane for mobility. FAC at ¶ 1. Due to mobility issues, he requires an accessible guestroom when traveling. Id. at ¶ 14. On or about November 7, 2020, when planning [*4]  a vacation in January 2021, Garcia visited Defendant's official reservation website for the AC Hotel by Marriott Los Angeles South Bay ("the Hotel"). Id. at ¶¶ 15-18. He alleges that the website lacked information on the Hotel's accessible guestrooms that he needed to determine "whether any of the guestrooms worked for him." Id. at ¶¶ 19-20. He alleges that Defendant's website simply labels some spaces and features "accessible" and fails to describe the accessible features in the guestrooms such as the bed, sink, toilet, and shower. Id. at ¶¶ 20, 26. While he acknowledges that the website describes the toilet as "at wheelchair height," he alleges that the website includes no information whatsoever about beds or sinks in accessible guestrooms. Id. at ¶¶ 27-28. According to the screenshot of the Hotel's website, "Guest Room Accessibility" includes: accessible guest rooms with 32" wide doorways, accessible routes from public entrance to accessible guest rooms, bathroom grab bars, bathtub grab bars, bathtub seat, lowered deadbolt locks, doors with lever handles, lowered electrical outlets, flashing door knockers, hearing accessible rooms and/or kits, roll-in shower, adjustable shower wand, [*5]  television with close-captioning, toilet seat at wheelchair height, transfer shower, accessible vanities, and lowered viewports. RJN, Ex. 1. The website's information about specific room types lists whether a room type, e.g., a room with two queen beds, is "mobility accessible" or "hearing accessible" and whether it offers roll-in showers or transfer showers. Id., Ex. 2. The lack of information on "core accessible features" deterred Garcia from booking a room at the Hotel. FAC at ¶ 30.
Originally filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, the case was removed to this Court on December 18, 2020. [Doc. # 1.] On March 12, 2021, Garcia filed his FAC. [Doc. # 11.] The FAC states two causes of action based on Defendant's failure to identify and describe accessible features in the Hotel: (1) violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"); and (2) violation of California's Unruh Civil Rights Act ("Unruh Act"). Id. at ¶¶ 36-44.
On March 14, 2021, Defendant filed the instant MTD pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). [Doc. # 12.]

III.

LEGAL STANDARD
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a defendant may seek to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must articulate "enough facts to state a claim [*6]  to relief that is plausible on its face." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). While a pleading need not contain "detailed factual allegations," it must contain "more than labels and conclusions" or "a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action." Id. at 555. "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). In evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint, courts must accept all factual allegations as true. Id. By contrast, legal conclusions are not entitled to the assumption of truth. Id.
Should a court dismiss certain claims, "[l]eave to amend should be granted unless the district court 'determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.'" Knappenberger v. City of Phoenix, 566 F.3d 936, 942 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc)).

IV.

DISCUSSION

A. Collateral Estoppel
Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, Defendant argues that the order to dismiss Garcia's claims in a similar case, Garcia v. Gateway Hotel, L.P., No. CV 20-10752-PA (GJSx) 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36034, 2021 WL 936176, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 25, 2021), bars Garcia from asserting the same causes of action in the present matter. To determine whether two different lawsuits involve the same cause of action, the Ninth Circuit examines the following factors:
(1) whether [*7]  rights or interests established in the prior judgment would be destroyed or impaired by prosecution of the second action; (2) whether substantially the same evidence is presented in the two actions; (3) whether the two suits involve infringement of the same right; and (4) whether the two suits arise out of the same transactional nucleus of facts.
Costantini v. Trans World Airlines, 681 F.2d 1199, 1201 (9th Cir. 1982) (quoting Harris v. Jacobs, 621 F.2d 341, 343 (9th Cir. 1980)). The final criterion is the most important. Id.
Only the third factor weighs in Garcia's favor. Defendant was not a party to the Gateway case and therefore no rights and interests established in the Gateway judgment would be impaired. While Gateway and the current action both allege inaccessible hotel websites, Garcia's claims here arise from a different transactional nucleus of facts and require different evidence from Gateway because this case and Gateway involve different hotels and different websites. Thus, collateral estoppel does not bar Garcia's claims here.

B. ADA Claim
Title III of the ADA prohibits "any person who owns, leases . . . or operates a place of public accommodation" from discriminating against individuals based on disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). When pursuing claims under Title III of the ADA, a plaintiff must prove "(1) [he] is disabled within the meaning of the [*8]  ADA; (2) the defendant is a private entity that owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation; and (3) the plaintiff was denied accommodation by the defendant because of his disability." Arizona ex rel. Goddard v. Harkins Amusement Enters., Inc., 603 F.3d 666, 670 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Molski v. M.J. Cable, Inc., 481 F.3d 724, 730 (9th Cir. 2007)).
Since Defendant disputes neither the validity of Garcia's disability nor its status as the owner, operator, or lessor of a public accommodation, only the third element is at issue. Garcia claims that Defendant denied him public accommodation under Section 36.302(e) of the ADA, which requires public accommodations to modify any reservation process to "[i]dentify and describe accessible features in the hotels and guest rooms offered through its reservations service in enough detail to reasonably permit individuals with disabilities to assess independently whether a given hotel or guest room meets his or her accessibility needs." 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(e)(1)(ii). He argues that by failing to identify and describe "core accessibility features" on the Hotel's website, Defendant prevented Garcia from independently assessing whether the available guest rooms would work for his specific needs as a wheelchair user. FAC at ¶ 30. He concedes that the Hotel's website provided some information describing various accessible room features, such as a [*9]  toilet seat "at wheelchair height," but seeks more information about the wheelchair-accessibility of specific features such as room entrances, beds, toilets, sinks, showers, and bathtubs. Id. at ¶ 28. His FAC ignores that the Hotel's website in fact provides information about bathroom grab bars and other bathtub and shower accessibility features, as well as 32-inch wide doorways, accessible routes, lever-handled doors, and other features, and that the Hotel's website specifies which rooms are accessible for guests with mobility impairments. RJN, Ex. 1 & 2.
Title III of the ADA does not specify what precise features must be identified and described on a reservation website to satisfy section 36.302(e)(1)(ii). Defendant points to Department of Justice ("DOJ") commentary to this rule which states that a reservations system is not intended to be an accessibility survey." 28 C.F.R. Pt. 36, App A, "Title III Regulations 2010 Guidance and Section-by-Section Analysis" (the "2010 Guidance"). Instead, the 2010 Guidance suggests that hotels in compliance with 1991 ADA standards should describe the type of room, the size and number of beds, the type of accessible bathing facility, and communication features to provide "sufficient" information [*10]  for many guests with disabilities to be "comfortable making reservations." Id. The 2010 Guidance contemplates that individuals may need to contact the hotel or reservations service for more detailed information about the specific layout of the room, grab-bar locations, and other features. Id.
The Court defers to the DOJ's interpretations of the ADA Accessibility Guidelines ("ADAAG"). Kohler v. Presidio Intern, Inc., 782 F.3d 1064, 1069 (9th Cir. 2015) (holding DOJ interpretations of the ADAAG are "entitled to substantial deference"). Defendant's website, the contents of which the Plaintiff refers to extensively in the FAC, describes which room types are "accessible" and provides brief descriptions of numerous accessible features. Such information exceeds the suggestions made by the DOJ and permits individuals with disabilities to make an informed decision, and any individual also can call the Hotel for more specific information. The Hotel's reservations website is therefore accessible to Garcia and other individuals with disabilities.
Other courts have come to similar conclusions for cases involving nearly identical facts. In Love v. Marriott Hotel Services, Inc., No. CV 20-07137-TSH, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41081, 2021 WL 810252 (N.D. Cal. March 3, 2021), the court determined that the hotel defendant Marriott's website complied with section 36.302(e)(1) because it listed accessibility features of [*11]  the guest rooms closely resembling the list on the Hotel's website at issue here. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41081, [WL] at *6-8 (noting that Marriott's website listed, inter alia, 32-inch wide doorways, bathroom grab bars, roll-in showers, adjustable shower wands, and other features, but did not specify accessibility features of beds). Similar accessibility features were listed on the hotel's website in Garcia v. Gateway, No. CV 20-10752-PA (GJSx) 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36034, 2021 WL 936176 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 25, 2021). As the court in Gateway noted, the hotel cannot be required to state on their website their compliance with each requirement of the ADAAG, which is more than 250 pages long. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36034, [WL] at *5. Like the unsuccessful plaintiffs in Love and Gateway, Garcia does not cite case law, statutes, regulations, or other administrative interpretations to support the level of detail he requests Defendant to publish on the Hotel's website. Thus, even taking all of Garcia's factual allegations as true, the Hotel's website satisfies the requirements of section 36.302(e)(1).
For the foregoing reasons, Garcia fails to state a claim under the ADA because the FAC and judicially noticeable documents indicate that the Hotel's website complies with section 36.302(e)(1). Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's MTD with respect to the ADA claim. Because any future amendment would be futile, the dismissal is without leave to [*12]  amend and with prejudice.

C. Unruh Act Claim
Under California's Unruh Act, a "violation of the right of any individual under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 . . . shall also constitute a violation of this section." Cal. Civ. Code § 51(f). Because Garcia's ADA claim fails, he also fails to state a claim under the Unruh Act. The Court therefore GRANTS Defendant's MTD the Unruh Act claim.

V.

CONCLUSION
In light of the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendant's MTD, with prejudice.
IT IS SO ORDERED.

JUDGMENT
Pursuant to the Court's Order granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss,
IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the above-captioned action is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. Judgment is hereby entered in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff.
