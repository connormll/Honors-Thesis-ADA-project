Opinion



ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [ECF No. 61] AND DENYING DEFENDANT'S COUNTERCLAIM MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [ECF No. 64]
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 61] (the "Motion") and Affirmative Motion for Summary Judgment on Defendant's Counterclaims [ECF No. 64] (the "Counterclaim [*2]  Motion"). The Court has considered the Motion, Plaintiff's Response in Opposition [ECF Nos. 76 and 87], Defendant's Reply in Support of the Motion [ECF No. 82], the parties' Joint Statement of Undisputed Facts [ECF No. 59], Defendant's Statement of Material Facts [ECF No. 60], Plaintiff's Statements of Material Facts [ECF Nos. 75 and 86], Defendant's Supplemental and Reply Statements of Material Facts [ECF Nos. 81 and 90], and the full record in this case. Additionally, the Court has considered the Counterclaim Motion, Plaintiff's Response in Opposition [ECF No. 89], Defendant's Reply in Support of the Motion [ECF No. 91], the parties' Joint Statement of Undisputed Facts [ECF No. 62], Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts and Additional Facts [ECF No. 88], and all relevant filings. The Court also held a hearing on the Motion and Counterclaim Motion. For the reasons set forth herein, the Motion is GRANTED, and the Counterclaim Motion is DENIED.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND1
This case is an employment dispute involving allegations of discrimination and retaliation based on sexual orientation and disability. The material facts viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff as the non-moving party [*3]  are as follows.
Plaintiff Loren Bowen, who is a gay man, was hired by Defendant Quest as a Logistics Supervisor on March 3, 2014 [ECF No. 59 ¶3; ECF No. 59-2, p. 1; ECF No. 1 ¶10]. Plaintiff worked alongside Kevin Collins, who was hired by Quest in 1988 and held several different roles before his promotion to Logistics Supervisor in the "2010s" [ECF No. 59-6, p. 2:7-14]. Both Plaintiff and Collins reported to Karen Van Doren, whose role as Logistics Manager involved, among other things, supervising the Logistics Supervisors, including Plaintiff [ECF No. 59 ¶5]. Plaintiff's claims arise largely out of what Plaintiff described as a "personal dispute" with Van Doren, as well as alleged discrimination and harassment by Van Doren [ECF No. 1 ¶15; ECF No. 59 ¶14].
Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that, starting as early as February 2015, Van Doren would call him "Becky" [ECF No. 59 ¶14; ECF No. 59-13, pp. 5-6]. Plaintiff contends that this was meant to "humiliate and degrade" him based on his status as a gay man [ECF No. 86-1 ¶4]. Plaintiff testified that Van Doren's "Becky" comments were "constant," although he also stated that they did not occur every day, and their frequency was "impossible [*4]  to quantify" [ECF No. 75-3, pp. 40:20-41:4, 42:7-9]. Plaintiff also testified that, as early as July 2015, Plaintiff asked Van Doren to stop calling him Becky, but Van Doren simply would not respond [ECF No. 75-3, pp. 39:24-40:11, 44:2-5].
As part of her role as Logistics Manager, Van Doren would give Plaintiff feedback on his job performance [ECF No. 59 ¶17]. For example, on January 2, 2015, Van Doren authored and approved Plaintiff's performance review for 2014, which gave Plaintiff an "achieves expectation" rating [ECF No. 59-8, p. 3; ECF No. 86-1 ¶6]. The 2014 performance review contained some critical comments, noting that Plaintiff "needs to listen more to his staff, get to know them and their work styles before becoming so critical" [ECF No. 59 ¶9; ECF No. 59-8, p. 3]. Van Doren's 2014 performance review also noted that Plaintiff "occasionally procrastinates," and that he should "[s]top criticizing the things that will not or cannot change and learn to work with what he has" [ECF No. 59 ¶9; ECF No. 59-8, p. 3]. On February 4, 2015, Van Doren sent an email to both Plaintiff and Collins memorializing salient points from their reprimand conversation regarding a "lack of communication" [*5]  [ECF No. 59 ¶10; ECF No. 59-9, pp. 1-2].
On August 6, 2015, Van Doren placed Plaintiff on an informal Performance Improvement Plan ("PIP") [ECF No. 90-3]. Van Doren's email sending the PIP stated: "Remember this is an informal PIP unless there is not substantial improvement" [ECF No. 90-3]. Plaintiff asserts that the informal PIP was in retaliation for his complaining to Van Doren, in July 2015, about her calling him "Becky" [ECF No. 86-1 ¶¶7-8].
On November 12, 2015, Van Doren placed Plaintiff on a formal PIP requiring Plaintiff to complete various steps over a 90-day period, including, among other things, providing weekly progress updates [ECF No. 59-11, p. 4]. The formal PIP stated that "[t]he performance issues to date have caused stress and friction between us and our Team as a unit" [ECF No. 59-11, p. 4]. Plaintiff completed the steps outlined in the formal PIP on January 22, 2016 [ECF No. 86-1 ¶9; ECF No. 59-11, p. 6]. On March 29, 2016, Van Doren authored and approved Plaintiff's performance review, which gave Plaintiff a "successful performance" rating for 2015 [ECF No. 86-1 ¶10; ECF No. 59 ¶13; ECF No. 59-12].
During this time, Plaintiff called Van Doren "Becky" on at least [*6]  one occasion [ECF No. 59 ¶15]. For example, in an April 18, 2016 email, Van Doren referred to having a "blonde" moment, stating: "Ok duh had me a Sarah moment looking at calendar wrong :)," to which Plaintiff responded "LOL Becky!" [ECF No. 59 ¶15; ECF No. 59-14, p. 1]. On November 2, 2016, Plaintiff messaged Van Doren "Rhonda is dead and has been replaced!" Van Doren responded by stating, "sorry did you get a becky this time LOL." Plaintiff then responded "LOL no." Both "Becky" and "Rhonda" were used in this instance to refer to Plaintiff's car [ECF No. 59-13, pp. 7, 9; ECF No. 59-15, p. 1]. Later in that conversation, Plaintiff and Van Doren made plans for a friendly "lunch date" [ECF No. 59-15, p. 3]. Plaintiff avers that in November of 2016, he approached Van Doren to request that she refer to him using his name rather than "Becky" [ECF No. 75-1, ¶¶11-12].
On January 17, 2017, Plaintiff interviewed for the position of "Manager of Fleet Operations" [ECF No. 75-1 ¶19]. The listed job requirements for this position included: "demonstrated leadership ability," "[e]xcellent communication and presentation skills," and a "Bachelor's degree or the equivalent experience" [ECF No. 59-23, [*7]  p. 3]. Quest eventually filled this position with another employee named Dennis Schroeder, who had been hired initially by Quest in 2011, held a B.A. in business management and aviation administration, and consistently received "excellent" or "exceptional" ratings in performance reviews [ECF No. 59 ¶¶31-32]. Plaintiff's highest level of education is high school graduate [ECF No. 59-13, p. 2:17-18].
On January 23, 2017, Van Doren presented Plaintiff with a "Summary of Discussion for Attendance" form in response to his several unscheduled absences and the fact that he had left early from work several times [ECF No. 59 ¶37; ECF No. 59-29, pp. 1-2]. Two days later, on January 25, 2017, Plaintiff filed a complaint with HR, which complained that Van Doren was unfairly using unscheduled paid time off for his absences and speaking to him in a derogatory manner by calling him "Becky" [ECF No. 59 ¶38; ECF No. 59-30]. This was Plaintiff's first formal complaint to HR [ECF No. 59 ¶38]. On January 26, 2017, Van Doren discussed Plaintiff's January 20, 2017 "Summary of Discussion for Attendance" form with HR, who advised Van Doren to replace that document with a "Summary of Discussion for Performance" [*8]  [ECF No. 59 ¶39]. That same day, Van Doren sent an email to Plaintiff letting him know about the replacement, apologizing for her mistake, and reminding Plaintiff to notify Van Doren when Plaintiff would not be available at work [ECF No. 59-31, p. 1]. Quest closed the complaint on February 3, 2017 [ECF No. 75-1 ¶23].
On February 28, 2017, Van Doren gave Plaintiff his 2016 performance review, which gave Plaintiff a "development needed" rating [ECF No. 59 ¶40; ECF No. 59-32]. On March 3, 2017, Plaintiff sought out a meeting with George Lloyd, Senior Director of Logistics, to discuss Plaintiff's concern with Van Doren [ECF No. 75-1 ¶25; ECF No. 90-5; ECF No. 59-27 ¶¶1-2]. After that meeting, Plaintiff filed a second complaint with HR against Van Doren alleging improper discipline, discriminatory language, hostile workplace, retaliation, and improper performance evaluation [ECF No. 75-1 ¶27].
Around that same time, in early March 2017, one of Plaintiff's subordinate employees complained that Plaintiff was giving 30 to 60 second evaluation reviews [ECF No. 59 ¶42]. This prompted the HR employee handling the complaint to direct Plaintiff to go through the review more thoroughly with Plaintiff's [*9]  subordinate employees, stating "30-60 seconds is not the way to do a review" [ECF No. 59-33]. On March 8, 2021, Van Doren reached out to HR to discuss Plaintiff's performance issues [ECF No. 59 ¶43]. Van Doren was told by HR to meet with Plaintiff and "determine what action is appropriate (corrective action, counseling, PIP, etc)" [ECF No. 59-34, p. 3]. On March 14, 2017, Van Doren put Plaintiff on an Individual Development Plan designed to get Plaintiff to give better feedback to his subordinates by, among other things, requiring Plaintiff to spend "at least fifteen minutes or more" going over performance reviews line by line [ECF No. 59 ¶44; ECF No. 59-35]. Later in March, at HR's recommendation and direction, Van Doren began working on a PIP to supplement the corrective action [ECF No. 59 ¶¶45-46].
On March 15, 2017, Plaintiff applied for medical leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), with the approval of his doctor, Myron Davidson, citing severe headaches, severe chronic liver disease, severe diarrhea, and anxiety [ECF No. 59 ¶47; ECF No. 59-36]. Plaintiff contends that these symptoms were brought on by work stress related to Van Doren's alleged retaliation [ECF No. 86-1 ¶29]. Plaintiff's medical leave [*10]  began on March 23, 2017 [ECF No. 59-13, p. 15:13-15]. Although Plaintiff's FMLA leave expired on June 14, 2017, Plaintiff requested a leave extension through at least July 5, 2017 [ECF No. 59 ¶51; ECF No. 59-41].
On July 5, 2017, Plaintiff applied for additional leave under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") with the approval of his psychiatrist, Dr. Amy Kosches [ECF No. 59 ¶52]. Plaintiff's application stated that he was unable to work due to "depression, anxiety, agitation, irritability, concentration, short-term memory, debilitating headaches, fatigue due to sleep deprivation, back pain, neck pain, panic attacks, stress or anxiety related diarrhea" [ECF No. 59-42, p. 2]. Dr. Kosches listed Plaintiff's impairments as "bipolar disorder and panic [disorder]" and stated that Plaintiff "currently cannot perform work of any kind [at] this time" [ECF No. 59-42, pp. 4-5].
On July 6, 2017, Senior Employee Relations Partner William Catogge, who had been monitoring Plaintiff's leave, sent an email to Plaintiff inquiring about his return [ECF No. 59 ¶50; ECF No. 59-44, p. 2 ("Can you please contact me regarding your return to work . . . . You were scheduled to return to work today and contact myself or Karen with regards [*11]  to your return. As of this morning I have not heard from you.")]. Plaintiff responded that he did not have a phone and had requested an extension of his medical leave [ECF No. 59 ¶53]. Catogge replied that Quest still expected Plaintiff to advise if he was not going to return by then, and that Plaintiff could have notified Quest via email [ECF No. 59-44, p. 1]. Catogge also stated that Plaintiff's FMLA leave had expired, and that he would be sending Plaintiff a letter stating that his position at Quest would be replaced [ECF No. 59-44, p. 1]. On July 7, 2017, Plaintiff emailed Catogge, stating "I'd like to discuss returning to work next week with you. Is there a good time I can call you to discuss?" [ECF No. 59 ¶55; ECF No. 59-46, p. 1]. During that call with Catogge, Plaintiff offered to return to work but requested an accommodation of 2.5 hours of paid time off per week to attend doctors' appointments [ECF No. 86-1 ¶37; ECF No. 59 ¶56]. Quest counter-proposed changing Plaintiff's shift schedule from the morning shift to the "third shift," which spanned the hours from 3:00 pm to 12:00am and included a 10% pay increase [ECF No. 59 ¶57]. This schedule change would allow Plaintiff greater [*12]  flexibility to attend doctors' appointments in the morning without missing work [ECF No. 59-27 ¶4]. Additionally, the accommodation included 2.5 hours of paid time off per week [ECF No. 59 ¶57; ECF No. 59-47, p. 2]. Plaintiff accepted Quest's proposed accommodation without further comment [ECF No. 59-47, p. 1; ECF No. 59-27 ¶6; ECF No. 59 ¶59].
On July 18, 2017, Plaintiff returned to work at Quest [ECF No. 59 ¶61]. The following day, on July 19, 2017, Van Doren presented Plaintiff with a PIP, which she had been directed by HR to prepare back in March, relating to various performance issues from before Plaintiff's leave [ECF No. 59-49; ECF No. 59-5 ¶3]. Van Doren emailed Plaintiff on August 3, 2017, to follow up about PIP-related tasks that were still outstanding [ECF No. 59-50]. Later that day, on August 3, 2017, Plaintiff sent Van Doren an email stating that he was leaving for the day and did not feel well [ECF No. 59-51]. That same day, Plaintiff began a second leave of absence, which was to go through September 1, 2017 [ECF No. 59 ¶64; ECF No. 86-1 ¶]. Quest approved Plaintiff's short-term disability leave in August of 2017 based on the representations that Plaintiff made in his [*13]  ADA application and continued to pay him his regular salary [ECF No. 59-1 ¶¶6-7].
On August 15, 2017, while on his second medical leave, Plaintiff called Quest's HR Department and emailed Catogge to complain that he had not received his paycheck from August 14, 2017 [ECF No. 59 ¶¶66-67; ECF No. 59-52]. HR had directed Van Doren on August 9, 2017, to adjust Plaintiff's leave of absence in the computer system from paid to unpaid so that Plaintiff's disability benefits would be automatic, and HR confirmed that Van Doren "did everything perfectly" on her end [ECF No. 81-3, p. 1]. HR reviewed the record and adjusted Plaintiff's check the same day so he could get paid [ECF No. 59-52].
On October 26, 2017, while still on paid leave from Quest, Plaintiff interviewed for an Operations Supervisor position at another company called AmeriGas [ECF No. 59 ¶68; ECF No. 59-54]. Plaintiff accepted the AmeriGas position the following day, on October 27, 2017 [ECF No. 59 ¶70; ECF No. 59-56]. Plaintiff represented to AmeriGas at this time that he did not have a disability [ECF No. 59 ¶71; ECF No. 59-57]. On November 6, 2017, again while still on paid leave from Quest, Plaintiff began working full-time at [*14]  AmeriGas in his new role as Operations Supervisor [ECF No. 59 ¶74; ECF No. 59-59]. And then finally, on November 22, 2017, Catogge sent an email to Plaintiff notifying him that Quest did not have an open position for him to return to following his over seven months of total leave [ECF No. 59 ¶¶47, 61, 64, 75], and further noting that his last day at Quest would be November 24, 2017 [ECF No. 59 ¶75; ECF No. 59-60; ECF No. 59-1].2 At the time, Catogge was unaware that Plaintiff already had begun working full-time at AmeriGas [ECF No. 59-1 ¶8]. Quest paid Plaintiff his regular salary through November 25, 2017 [ECF No. 59 ¶76; ECF No. 59-61].

PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Plaintiff filed his complaint against Quest on October 24, [*15]  2019 [ECF No. 1]. The complaint asserts six claims: (1) Count I: Discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.; (2) Count II: Retaliation in violation of Title VII; (3) Count III: Discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.; (4) Count IV: Retaliation in violation of the ADA; (5) Count V: Discrimination in violation of the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992 (FCRA), Fla. Stat. § 760 et seq., which was patterned after Title VII; and (6) Count VI: Retaliation in violation of the FCRA. Plaintiff seeks relief in the form of emotional distress and economic damages, punitive damages, and liquidated damages, as well as attorneys' fees and other costs [ECF No. 1, pp. 21-22]. Counts I and V pursue three separate theories of discrimination under Title VII and FCRA: disparate treatment, hostile work environment, and failure to promote [ECF No. 87, pp. 3-13].
On January 21, 2021, Defendant filed its Answer, asserting counterclaims against Plaintiff for common law fraud and unjust enrichment under Florida law [ECF No. 43]. On March 19, 2021, Defendant moved for summary judgment on all counts [ECF No. 61]. On the same day, Defendant moved for summary judgment on its counterclaims [ECF No. 64].

LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate where there is "no genuine issue as to any material [*16]  fact [such] that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Fed R. Civ. P. 56(a). An issue of fact is "material" if it might affect the outcome of the case under the governing law. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). It is "genuine" if the evidence could lead a reasonable jury to find for the non-moving party. See id.; see also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986).
At summary judgment, the moving party has the burden of proving the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, and all factual inferences are drawn in favor of the non-moving party. See Allen v. Tyson Foods Inc., 121 F.3d 642, 646 (11th Cir. 1997). Courts must consider the entire record and not just the evidence singled out by the parties. See Clinkscales v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 831 F.2d 1565, 1570 (11th Cir. 1987). The non-moving party's presentation of a "mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" in support of its position is insufficient to overcome summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.
"For factual issues to be considered genuine, they must have a real basis in the record." Mann v. Taser Int'l, Inc., 588 F.3d 1291, 1303 (11th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). Speculation or conjecture cannot create a genuine issue of material fact. Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1181 (11th Cir. 2005). The moving party has the initial burden of showing the absence of a genuine issue as to any material fact. Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991). In assessing whether the moving party has met this burden, the court must view the movant's evidence and all factual inferences arising from it in the light [*17]  most favorable to the non-moving party. Denney v. City of Albany, 247 F.3d 1172, 1181 (11th Cir. 2001). Once the moving party satisfies its initial burden, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to come forward with evidence showing a genuine issue of material fact that precludes summary judgment. Bailey v. Allgas, Inc., 284 F.3d 1237, 1243 (11th Cir. 2002); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).

DISCUSSION

A. Discrimination under Title VII and the FCRA (Counts I and V)
Title VII provides that it is unlawful for an employer "to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2. The Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992 ("FCRA") prohibits the same conduct, see Fla. Stat. §§ 760.01-.11, and the Court looks to applicable Eleventh Circuit case law in applying both statutes, see Harper v. Blockbuster Entm't. Corp., 139 F.3d 1385, 1388 (11th Cir. 1998) ("The Florida courts have held that decisions construing Title VII are applicable when considering claims under the Florida Civil Rights Act, because the Florida act was patterned after Title VII."); Johnson v. Miami-Dade Cty., 948 F.3d 1318, 1325 (11th Cir. 2020) ("[B]ecause the FCRA is based on Title VII, decisions construing Title VII apply to the analysis of FCRA claims.").

1. Disparate Treatment
To make out a prima facie case of discrimination for disparate treatment under Title VII [*18]  and the FCRA, Plaintiff must show: "(1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) he was replaced by a person outside his protected class or was treated less favorably than a similarly-situated individual outside his protected class." Maynard v. Bd. of Regents of Div. of Universities of Fla. Dep't of Educ. ex rel. Univ. of S. Fla., 342 F.3d 1281, 1289 (11th Cir. 2003); see also Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir. 2008). Where, as here, the Title VII discrimination claim is based on circumstantial evidence, courts apply the familiar burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Crawford v. City of Fairburn, 482 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir. 2007); Brown v. Alabama Dep't of Transp., 597 F.3d 1160, 1181 (11th Cir. 2010). Under this framework, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation. See Shannon v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 774 F. App'x 529, 544 (11th Cir. 2019). If the plaintiff crosses this threshold, the burden shifts to the defendant to proffer a valid, non-discriminatory reason for the termination. Id. Once the employer offers a valid reason, the burden reverts to the plaintiff, who then must show that the employer's reason was pretextual. Id.
There is no dispute that Plaintiff belongs to a protected class based on his sexual orientation [ECF No. 87, p. 4 ("[T]here exists no dispute as to element one, Mr. Bowen's protected class")]. See Bostock v. Clayton Cty., Georgia, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1741, 207 L. Ed. 2d 218 (2020) ("[I]t is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual . . . without discriminating [*19]  against that individual based on sex."). Nor is there any dispute that Plaintiff was qualified for the position [ECF No. 61 pp. 5-13]. Rather, the Motion focuses on the third and fourth elements—whether Plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action and whether Quest treated situated employees outside his protected class more favorably [ECF No. 61 pp. 5-13].
Defendant argues that summary judgment is warranted based on the third element because the internal discipline and feedback actions taken by Quest, including negative performance reviews, personal improvement plans ("PIPs"), and written reprimands, did not affect Plaintiff's salary or the terms of his employment and therefore do not constitute adverse employment actions as a matter of law [ECF No. 61, pp. 7-8]. Defendant further argues that, while termination does normally constitute an adverse employment action, in this case Quest's termination is a "nullity" because Plaintiff already had effectively resigned his employment at Quest by accepting and starting full-time employment at another company (AmeriGas) [ECF No. 61, pp. 8-10]. Plaintiff responds that Quest's actions are sufficiently adverse when viewed in the collective, [*20]  and he states that his termination still qualifies as adverse action under the relevant statutes because he wanted to return to work at Quest even though he started a new job at AmeriGas [ECF No. 87, p. 5].
"[T]o prove adverse employment action in a case under Title VII's anti-discrimination clause, an employee must show a serious and material change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Davis v. Town of Lake Park, Fla., 245 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir. 2001) (emphasis in original). "Tangible employment actions consist of things that affect continued employment or pay—things like terminations, demotions, suspensions without pay, and pay raises or cuts—as well as other things that are similarly significant standing alone." Monaghan v. Worldpay US, Inc., 955 F.3d 855, 860 (11th Cir. 2020).
It is questionable whether Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action within the meaning of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2, but even if he did, Plaintiff's claims still fail because there is no triable question as to whether Quest treated similarly situated employees more favorably.
On the question of adverse action, Plaintiff points basically to two categories of items. On one end, he identifies a series of intangible actions such as critical and/or negative performance reviews, the "PIPs," and "Summary of Discussion" documents setting [*21]  forth issues with Plaintiff's performance/attendance. On the other end, he cites his departure from Quest, classifying it as termination in the traditional sense even though by that point he had started work at another company. The Court addresses these in turn but ultimately assumes that Plaintiff's termination qualifies as adverse action as set forth below.
With respect to the performance reviews, etc., Plaintiff received two performance reviews for 2014 and 2016, which respectively gave "achieves expectations" and "development needed" ratings;3 a handful of performance improvement plans ("PIPs"), including an informal PIP given on August 6, 2015, which became a formal PIP on November 12, 2015; an Individual Development Plan given on March 14, 2017, and a second PIP issued on July 19, 2017; and a "Summary of Discussion for Attendance" written reprimand given on January 23, 2017, which later was altered to a "Summary of Discussion for Performance" [ECF No. 59 ¶¶8, 12, 37, 39, 40, 44, 62].
It is undisputed that neither the performance reviews, performance improvement plans, nor written reprimands altered Plaintiff's salary or employment terms [ECF No. 59 ¶¶8, 12, 13, 39, 40, 44, 62]. [*22]  Nor is there any evidence in the record to suggest a causal link between those earlier performance reviews or reprimands and Quest's decision in November 2017 to terminate Plaintiff's employment. Thus, at least with respect to the "intangible" reviews/PIPs, there is no genuine issue of material with respect to whether Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action. See Barnett v. Athens Reg'l Med. Ctr. Inc., 550 F. App'x 711, 714 (11th Cir. 2013) (affirming grant of summary judgment on Title VII, ADEA, and § 1981 discrimination claims in part because reprimands and negative performance reviews did not constitute adverse employment action).
Plaintiff also relies on Quest's termination of his employment as the applicable adverse decision, pointing to Catogge's email dated November 22, 2017 in which Catogge informed Plaintiff that Quest did not have a comparable job for him to return to and advising him of his last day [ECF No. 59-60]. Quest does not dispute that termination ordinarily qualifies as "adverse action" within the meaning of Title VII and FCRA, but argues instead that no such automatic conclusion is warranted here because Plaintiff effectively resigned when he accepted and started a new job at AmeriGas prior to Quest informing him that it did not have a comparable job for [*23]  him to return to. See Whitten v. City of Easley, 62 F. App'x 477, 481 (4th Cir. 2003) (finding that the plaintiff had "effectively tender[ed] his resignation" by "accept[ing] a full-time position with another company"). Plaintiff then responds that, even though he started a new job elsewhere, he still suffered an adverse employment action at the hands of Quest because his intention really was to return to work at Quest after starting his new job at AmeriGas [ECF No. 87, p. 20; ECF No. 86-1 ¶47]. Finally, Defendant offers the rejoinder that any claim on the part of Plaintiff that he intended to return to Quest is purely hypothetical and speculative.
Although Defendant makes a compelling case that Plaintiff's "termination" objectively is akin to resignation in this circumstance, the Court need not resolve that question here. There is at least arguably a question of fact on the "adverse" nature of Plaintiff's departure from Quest; his employment at Quest undoubtedly ceased as of November 24, 2017; that separation altered the terms of his employment and compensation; and although Plaintiff appears only to speculate that he wished to return to Quest someday despite starting a full-time job at another company [ECF No. 86-1 ¶47], the Court has located [*24]  no definitive guidance from the Eleventh Circuit to resolve the inquiry.
Accordingly, even assuming that Plaintiff's "termination" from Quest constitutes adverse employment action within the meaning of Title VII, Quest still is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the undisputed record does not show that Quest treated similarly situated employees outside his protected class more favorably. See Howard v. Hyundai Motor Mfg. Alabama, 754 F. App'x 798, 806 (11th Cir. 2018) (affirming summary judgment on behalf of defendant where the record showed comparator "was not treated more favorably" than plaintiff).
To meet the "comparator" assessment test required to make out a prima facie case for disparate treatment, Plaintiff must demonstrate that Plaintiff and his comparators are "similarly situated in all material respects." Lewis v. City of Union City, Georgia, 918 F.3d 1213, 1229 (11th Cir. 2019) (en banc). This standard is a functional analysis and does not require the comparators to be identical or even nearly so. Id. at 1227. Rather, the Eleventh Circuit has enumerated various "sorts of similarities" and guideposts that ordinarily mark a proper comparator. Id. at 1227-28 (noting that a similarly situated comparator "in all material respects" will have engaged in the "same basic conduct (or misconduct) as the plaintiff," will have been subject "to [*25]  the same employment policy, guideline, or rule as the plaintiff," "will ordinarily (although not invariably) have been under the jurisdiction of the same supervisor as the plaintiff," "will share the plaintiff's employment or disciplinary history").
The Quest employee that Plaintiff has chosen for comparison is Kevin Collins, but Collins is not similarly situated to Plaintiff in all material respects, and more fundamentally, Collins was not treated more favorably than Plaintiff. Plaintiff and Collins do share several similarities: they each held the same job title, "Logistics Supervisor," at the same office location, Miramar, and worked under the same supervisor, Van Doren [ECF No. 59 ¶6]. But Plaintiff does not dispute that Collins had a much longer employment tenure at Quest, and this is confirmed by the record. Collins was hired by Quest in 1988 and had worked for Quest in various roles 26 years longer than Plaintiff, who was hired in 2014 [ECF No. 59 ¶¶3, 6]. A second material difference is disciplinary history. Plaintiff points to a "Summary of Discussion for Attendance" document that he received after an attendance-related incident involving both Plaintiff and Collins, complaining [*26]  that he received a written reprimand and Collins did not. But Collins's record shows that he was written up twice in 2015 for "lack of communication" and as well as a handful of times in 2016 for non-attendance issues [ECF No 85, p. 14]. Moreover, the reprimand document on which Plaintiff relies lists four separate instances during which Plaintiff violated company attendance policy not involving Collins, in addition to the incident that involved them both [ECF No. 59-29]. These differences as to experience and disciplinary history are material to Plaintiff's allegations of disparate treatment. See Lewis, 918 F.3d at 1227 (noting that a similarly situated comparator "will share the plaintiff's employment or disciplinary history").
Moreover, there is no dispute that Collins was written up by Van Doren for attendance issues [ECF No. 59-6, p. 11:12-20]. Collins received multiple negative performance reviews and several written reprimands and warnings [ECF No. 59-21; ECF No. 59-22]. Ultimately, Van Doren recommended his termination [ECF No. 59-21]. And Quest did in fact terminate him after that [ECF No. 86-4, p. 39:19-20]. For these reasons, Plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of fact that he was treated [*27]  less favorably than a similarly situated individual outside his protected class. Summary judgment is warranted on his claims of disparate treatment under Title VII and FCRA (Counts I and V).

2. Hostile Work Environment
The same facts regarding name-calling by Van Doren inform the Court's analysis of Plaintiff's second theory of discrimination: hostile work environment. To make a prima facie case for hostile work environment under Title VII and FCRA, a plaintiff must show "(1) that he belongs to a protected group; (2) that he has been subject to unwelcome harassment; (3) that the harassment [was] based on a protected characteristic of the employee . . . ; (4) that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and create a discriminatorily abusive working environment; and (5) that the employer is responsible for such environment under either a theory of vicarious or of direct liability." Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., 277 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir. 2002).
The issue in this case pivots on element four—whether the alleged name calling by Van Doren was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment.
"Title VII is not a 'general civility code.'" Guthrie v. Waffle House, Inc., 460 F. App'x 803 (11th Cir. 2012) (quoting Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1998)). To be sufficiently [*28]  "severe or pervasive," the alleged conduct must be both objectively and subjectively offensive. Miller, 277 F.3d at 1276 (11th Cir. 2002) (citing Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21-22, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993)). In analyzing the objective severity and pervasiveness of alleged conduct, courts consider the following factors: "(1) the frequency of the conduct; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and (4) whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with the employee's job performance." Id.
In this case, construing the allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there is no triable issue as to whether Plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment.
First, the undisputed record raises significant doubt as to whether Plaintiff even was subjectively offended by these comments at the time. Although Plaintiff alleges that the "Becky" references were well under way by February 4, 2015 [ECF No. 59-13, p. 6], Plaintiff did not complain to HR about the references until January 25, 2017—nearly two years later [ECF No. 59 ¶38; ECF No. 59-30]. Additionally, the record contains multiple documented instances where Plaintiff expressed no concern whatsoever by the "Becky" name-calling, including at [*29]  least one occasion where Plaintiff himself used that term in a casual written communication to Van Doren, his supervisor [ECF No. 59-14, p. 1; ECF No. 59-13, pp. 7, 9; ECF No. 59-15, p. 1].
Second, viewed objectively, the use of the term "Becky" on this record does not rise to the level of a hostile work environment within the contours of Eleventh Circuit precedent. Plaintiff testified that the "Becky" name-calling was "constant," but he could not comment on the overall number of times it was said or approximate its frequency [ECF No. 75-3, pp. 40:20-41:4, 42:7-9]. In Fortson v. Carlson, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a grant of summary judgment in favor of the employer in a Title VII workplace harassment claim. 618 F. App'x 601, 607 (11th Cir. 2015). The Eleventh Circuit found that twelve episodes of harassment, nine of which involved "racially derogatory language—specifically, 'black ass' or 'black ass fool'" over the course of seven months—were neither objectively severe or pervasive to make a prima facie case for hostile work environment. Id. Likewise, in Guthrie v. Waffle House, Inc., the Eleventh Circuit addressed the degree of frequency relevant to a claim for hostile work environment. 460 F. App'x 803, 806 (11th Cir. 2012). There, the court found that [*30]  the plaintiff had failed to show frequent harassment where the record included a few dozen comments over the course of eleven months. Id. Thus, even assuming the "Becky" comments were derogatory or as frequent as Plaintiff alleges, the Court agrees that Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim.

3. Failure to Promote
Plaintiff also posits a third theory of discrimination under Title VII and FCRA: failure to promote [ECF No. 87, pp. 11-13]. Plaintiff alleges that the reason he did not get the Manager of Fleet Operations position for which he applied and interviewed in early 2017 was due to discriminatory animus.
"To establish a prima facie case of discriminatory failure to promote, a plaintiff must prove: (1) that he is a member of a protected class; (2) that he was qualified for and applied for the promotion; (3) that he was rejected; and (4) that other equally or less qualified employees who were not members of the protected class were promoted." Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1539 n.11 (11th Cir. 1997) (citing Wu v. Thomas, 847 F.2d 1480, 1483 (11th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1006, 109 S. Ct. 1641, 104 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1989).
Here, the undisputed record amply demonstrates that Dennis Schroeder, who ended up getting the job, was more qualified than Plaintiff. The position required a [*31]  "Bachelor's degree or the equivalent experience" [ECF No. 59-23, p. 3]. Plaintiff's highest level of education is high school graduate [ECF No. 59-13, p. 2:17-18]. Schroeder was hired by Quest in April 2011 and has a B.A. in business management and aviation administration [ECF No. 85, pp. 17-18]. By the time he was being considered for the Fleet Manager position, in early 2017, he had been working at Quest for almost six years [ECF No. 59 ¶31]. Schroeder received a Performance Evaluation rating of "Excellent" for 2014, "Exceptional Performance" for 2015, and "Exceptional Performance" for 2016 [ECF No. 85, pp. 22, 24, 28]. Thus, Schroeder had both a college degree and twice as much experience as Plaintiff (six years versus three years), and Schroeder held consistently superior performance reviews than Plaintiff. Plaintiff's failure to promote claim fails as a matter of law.

B. Discrimination under the ADA (Count III)
Subchapter I of the ADA prohibits employers from discriminating against their employees because of a disability. See Albra v. Advan, Inc., 490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111-12117). Section I of the ADA provides, in pertinent part: "No covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, [*32]  the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). This prohibition from discrimination includes an employer's failure to "mak[e] reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity." Id. at (b)(5)(A).
"To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show: (1) he is disabled; (2) he is a qualified individual; and (3) he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of his disability." Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2007). One way a plaintiff may establish the third prong is by showing that his employer failed to provide him with a reasonable accommodation for his disability. Id. at 1262.
Defendant disputes both that Plaintiff is disabled and that he is a qualified individual, pointing to Plaintiff's representation to AmeriGas in early November of 2017 that he did not have a disability [ECF No. 59 ¶71; ECF No. 59-57]. But Plaintiff has alleged that his [*33]  disability was short term, and that he had been cleared to work prior to that representation [ECF No. 86 ¶50]. Taking Plaintiff's allegations as true, his representation to AmeriGas is not necessarily inconsistent with his earlier claimed disability status. Thus, viewed in Plaintiff's favor, the Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated that he is a qualified individual with a disability.
The analysis then turns on element three of the ADA prima facie case: whether Quest violated the ADA by denying Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation. Plaintiff contends that Quest denied him a reasonable accommodation by refusing his requested accommodation of 2.5 hours of paid time off per week for doctor's visits, instead offering him a schedule change to move him to the night shift.
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Quest is entitled to summary judgment on this claim because there is no genuine issue of material fact that Quest provided Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation. "[T]here are limits to the accommodations an employer must provide. The key is 'reasonability,' meaning an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner that [*34]  the employee desires—or even provide that employee's preferred accommodation." D'Onofrio v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 964 F.3d 1014, 1022 (11th Cir. 2020), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 1435, 209 L. Ed. 2d 155 (2021) (citing Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 1997) ("[U]nder the ADA[,] a qualified individual with a disability is 'not entitled to the accommodation of her choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation.'")).
Here, there is significant record evidence that Plaintiff himself thought the accommodation was reasonable. For example, it is undisputed that when Quest proposed the night shift accommodation, Plaintiff accepted it 39 minutes later without any complaint or counteroffer [ECF No. 59-47, p. 1("Accepted. Thanks Bill.")]. The shift change came with a ten percent pay increase [ECF No. 59-27 ¶¶4-6]. Moreover, Plaintiff's therapy session notes from July 15, 2021, two days after Plaintiff accepted Quest's proposed accommodation, stated "[c]lient was very elated to report that he would be returning to work at more convenient hours and increase in pay differential" [ECF No. 59 ¶60; ECF No. 85, p. 35]. Because the accommodation Quest proposed and Plaintiff accepted was reasonable, there is no failure to accommodate under the ADA and Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.

C. Retaliation under Title VII, FCRA, and ADA (Counts II, IV, [*35]  and VI)
Title VII prohibits employers from retaliating against employees for their participation in certain statutorily protected activities:
It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees . . . because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.
42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). Likewise, the ADA and FCRA also contain anti-retaliation provisions. 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a) ("No person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter."); Fla. Stat. § 760.10(7) ("It is an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to discriminate against any person because that person has opposed any practice which is an unlawful employment practice under this section . . .").
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he participated in a statutorily protected [*36]  activity; (2) he experienced an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link exists between the protected activity and the adverse action. Goldsmith v. City of Atmore, 996 F.2d 1155, 1163 (11th Cir. 1993); see also Collado v. United Parcel Serv., Co., 419 F.3d 1143, 1158 (11th Cir. 2005) (listing the same essential elements for ADA retaliation claims). For retaliation claims, a plaintiff must demonstrate that his participation in protected activity was the "but-for" cause of the adverse employment action. Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 360, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013). Unlike with a Title VII discrimination claim, it is not enough to show simply that retaliation was a "motivating factor" in the adverse action. Id. (rejecting "motivating-factor standard" for anti-retaliation provision in Title VII).
Plaintiff alleges that Quest retaliated against him for complaining about Van Doren's name-calling and for requesting an accommodation [ECF No. 1 ¶¶103, 130, 147]. Defendant concedes that Plaintiff's complaints against Van Doren qualify as "statutorily protected activity" but disputes whether Plaintiff's request for an accommodation qualifies as such [ECF No. 61, pp. 28-29].
To satisfy the first element of a prima facie retaliation case when the purported statutorily protected activity is a request for an accommodation, it is sufficient if an employee has a good faith, objectively reasonable [*37]  belief that she is entitled to an accommodation based on disability. See Luna v. Walgreen Co., 575 F. Supp. 2d 1326, 1343 (S.D. Fla. 2008), aff'd, 347 F. App'x 469 (11th Cir. 2009) (citing Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998)). Accepting Plaintiff's allegations as true, the record supports Plaintiff's good faith, reasonable belief that he was disabled based on his therapist's diagnosis. Thus, Plaintiff has established that his request for an accommodation was a "protected activity" within the context of the relevant anti-retaliation provisions.
The next issue is whether Plaintiff has demonstrated the second element of retaliation—i.e., an adverse employment action. The standard for "adverse employment action" is different when analyzing Title VII's retaliation provision under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a) than it is for Title VII's substantive discrimination provision under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). See Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 67, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2000) ("[W]e conclude that Title VII's substantive provision and its antiretaliation provision are not coterminous."). "[T]he antiretaliation provision [under Title VII], unlike the substantive provision, is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment." Id. at 68. Rather, the test is whether "a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable [*38]  worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination." Id. at 68 (internal quotations omitted).
Here, as with Plaintiff's claims of discrimination, Plaintiff argues that he suffered adverse actions on account of the negative performance reviews, the performance improvement plans, the written reprimands, and his ultimate termination from Quest. For the same reasons discussed above, supra pp. 13-16, the Court assumes the existence of an adverse action even though Plaintiff already had started another full-time job before Quest advised him that it no longer had a position for him to return to following his more than seven months of leave.
This gets us to the question of causation—i.e., whether there is a genuine issue of material fact that Plaintiff's termination is causally linked to his protected activity. There is not. No reasonable juror wound find a causal connection between Plaintiff's protected activity and Quest's eventual termination notice dated November 22, 2017. All of Plaintiff's protected activity took place months before he was advised that Quest did not have an open position for him. Plaintiff filed his complaints against Van Doren in January and March of 2017 [ECF No. 59-30; [*39]  ECF No. 75-1 ¶27]. Additionally, Plaintiff requested his accommodation to return to work on July 7, 2017 [ECF No. 59-46, p. 1]. Quest sent Plaintiff the email terminating his employment over five months later, on November 22, 2017 [ECF No. 59-60]. Thus, even assuming the termination qualifies as adverse employment action, Plaintiff has not shown any evidence to establish a casual link between his protected activity and his eventual termination. See Higdon v. Jackson, 393 F.3d 1211, 1220-21 (11th Cir. 2004) (finding a three-month gap between the protected activity and adverse employment action was insufficient to establish causation under the ADA). Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's retaliation claims.4

D. Defendant's Counterclaims
By separate motion, Defendant moves for summary judgment, seeking judgment as a matter of law on its two counterclaims: (Count I) common law fraud and (Count II) common law unjust enrichment [ECF No. 64].
Both counterclaims concern the same set of facts. While on short-term disability leave at Quest, Plaintiff interviewed for a position as Operations Supervisor for AmeriGas on October 26, 2017 [ECF No. 62 ¶13]. He accepted the position the following day on October 27, 2017 [ECF No. 62 ¶16]. In [*40]  the process of accepting the position, Plaintiff represented to AmeriGas that he did not have a disability [ECF No. 62 ¶17]. On October 30, 2017, Plaintiff's doctor cleared him to return to work [ECF No. 62 ¶18]. On November 6, 2017, Plaintiff started working full-time in his new role at AmeriGas [ECF No. 62 ¶19]. He informed Quest on November 12, 2017 that he was released to return to work [ECF No. 62 ¶20].
Defendant alleges, based on these undisputed facts, that Plaintiff acted fraudulently and was unjustly enriched by failing to tell Quest that he was cleared for work despite collecting a paycheck while on disability leave. The Court disagrees that summary judgment is appropriate in favor of Quest on these counterclaims.
Under Florida law, the elements for common law fraud are: "(1) a false statement regarding a material fact; (2) the statement maker's knowledge that the representation is false; (3) intent that the representation induces another's reliance; and (4) consequent injury to the party acting in reliance." Thompkins v. Lil' Joe Recs., Inc., 476 F.3d 1294, 1315 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing Wadlington v. Cont'l Med. Servs., Inc., 907 So.2d 631, 632 (2005)). Similarly, the elements for unjust enrichment under Florida law are "a benefit conferred upon a defendant by the plaintiff, the defendant's appreciation of [*41]  the benefit, and the defendant's acceptance and retention of the benefit under circumstances that make it inequitable for him to retain it without paying the value thereof." Jackson-Jester v. Aziz, 48 So. 3d 88, 90-91 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2010) (quoting Swindell v. Crowson, 712 So. 2d 1162, 1163 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1998)).
Plaintiff contends that, on October 31, 2017, he notified third party ADA servicer CIGNA of his clearance to work on November 6, 2017 [ECF No. 88-1 ¶48]. Plaintiff further declares that he specifically asked CIGNA whether he should notify Quest as well and was told that CIGNA would take care of notifying Quest [ECF No. 88-1 ¶48]. On this basis, Plaintiff argues that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff thought he had taken sufficient steps to notify Quest. The Court agrees. Even accepting Defendant's contention that Plaintiff had an affirmative duty to disclose his change in disability status to Quest, a material question of fact exists as to whether, given the steps Plaintiff took to notify Quest through CIGNA, Plaintiff possessed the requisite intent to keep Quest in the dark about his ability to work. The Court cannot resolve this factual dispute on summary judgment. Accordingly, Defendant's motion as to its counterclaims is denied for both Counts I and II.

CONCLUSION
 [*42] For the foregoing reasons, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows:
1. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 61] is GRANTED.
2. Judgment in favor of Defendant will be entered by separate order.
3. Defendant's Affirmative Motion for Summary Judgment on Defendant's Counterclaims [ECF No. 64] is DENIED.
4. In light of this Order, Defendant will have until June 9, 2021 to show cause why this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the remaining state-law counterclaims, both as a matter of traditional diversity and supplemental jurisdiction.
DONE AND ORDERED in Fort Pierce, Florida this June 2, 2021.
