CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings: IN CHAMBERS - COURT ORDER
Before the Court is a Motion for Summary Judgment filed by defendant Michael Baker International, Inc. ("Defendant" or "MBI") (Docket No. 45). Pursuant to Rule 78 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 7-15, the Court finds that this matter is appropriate for decision without oral argument. The hearing calendared for June 15, 2020, is vacated, and the matter taken off calendar.

I. Factual and Procedural Background
Plaintiff Atef Elzeftawy ("Plaintiff" or "Atef") commenced this action on April 8, 2019, in Orange County Superior Court. Alleging the [*2]  existence of diversity jurisdiction, Defendant removed the action to this Court on May 24, 2019. Plaintiff's Complaint alleges a claim for employment discrimination in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code § 12940, for failing to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process, failure to provide a reasonable accommodation, failure to hire, discrimination, and retaliation. Plaintiff additionally alleges a claim for wrongful adverse employment action in violation of public policy.
Plaintiff, an engineer and construction manager, worked for Pernix Group, Inc. ("Pernix"), a construction company, beginning in 2012. In 2014, Pernix entered into a joint venture agreement with Kaseman LLC, a subsidiary of MBI, to construct a communications facility in South Korea for the United States Army Corps of Engineers (the "Pernix-Kaseman JV").1 Plaintiff signed an international deployment agreement with Pernix in September 2016 and later traveled to South Korea to work on the Pernix-Kaseman JV. While working on the Pernix-Kaseman JV, Plaintiff served as the Director of Engineering and Special Projects, reported to Ed McSweeney, President of Pernix Federal, was paid by Pernix, [*3]  submitted and received tax documents listing Pernix as his employer, was promoted by Pernix, and was reimbursed for business expenses by Pernix.
Between September and November 2016, Plaintiff communicated his concerns about safety conditions at the Pernix-Kaseman JV jobsite. On November 11, 2016, Plaintiff suffered significant injuries, including a broken fibula and heel, when he stepped in an open hole at the Pernix-Kaseman JV jobsite. Plaintiff's injuries required that he undergo surgery. Plaintiff requested leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") and applied for short term disability benefits. Documentation submitted by Plaintiff concerning his disability leave identifies Pernix as Plaintiff's employer. Following his surgery, Plaintiff's physicians cleared him to return to work on January 5, 2017, with restrictions that, among other limitations, initially limited him to desk duties.
On January 26, 2017, Plaintiff emailed his résumé to Harold Chappell, a vice president at MBI with whom Plaintiff was acquainted. Plaintiff expressed interest in obtaining a job at MBI's office in Orange County and stated that MBI might "consider hiring me to work out of [the Orange County [*4]  location] and support projects for you from this location as well." On February 10, 2017, Plaintiff also emailed Ellen Dwyer, MBI's Director of Business Development—International Programs, to express interest in working at MBI and request that Ms. Dwyer forward his resume to MBI's Orange County office "with the hope to find an opportunity to join the MBI team."
On February 6, 2017, MBI posted a job opening online for a Senior Construction Technical Manager Position (the "Position"). MBI posted the Position in connection with its pursuit of a highway construction project with the Orange County Transportation Authority ("OCTA"). MBI states that the Position was contingent upon MBI's winning the project with OCTA. At some point between March 3, 2017 and March 10, 2017, Plaintiff submitted an online application for the Position under the names "Mark Asami" or "Atef Asami." This was the only position at MBI for which Plaintiff submitted an online job application, despite his knowledge of other job postings by MBI. In his Deposition, Plaintiff states that despite being aware of other jobs MBI posted, the Position was "the best fit for my skills" and "I did not want to take a chance of applying [*5]  to multiple openings, because in the fear of jeopardy of saying, well, this guy is going on a dartboard and just whatever is going to stick is going to stick. So I preferred . . . to apply for this specific position as most suitable." (Elzeftaway Depo. 200-6-13.) Although Plaintiff had mentioned his injury-related work restrictions to Mr. Chappel and Ms. Dwyer, among others at MBI, his online application for the Position did not disclose the existence of a disability or any job restrictions. Nor did Plaintiff's online application communicate any need for, or request, a reasonable accommodation in connection with his application for the Position.
Between March 10, 2017 and April 14, 2017, Plaintiff sent follow up emails to MBI personnel about the Position, including Ms. Dwyer, John Dietrick, MBI's National Director — Bridge and Highway Practice. On March 23, 2017, Mr. Dietrick forwarded Plaintiff's email, résumé and cover letter to MBI's Regional Director (West Region) Anna Lantin, requesting that she provide "the right point of contact in Irvine." In response, Lantin identified MBI's Irvine/Santa Ana Office Executive Mike Tylman, and MBI's Vice President of Construction Services Jerome [*6]  Ruddins as "the decision makers." On April 12, 2017, Mr. Dietrick, Mr. Tylman, and MBI's National Construction Services Practice Director, Tom Zagorski, corresponded via email regarding Plaintiff's candidacy for the Position. Mr. Zagorski and Mr. Tylman state that they had no knowledge or, or could not recall, that Plaintiff complained about safety conditions at the Pernix-Kaseman JV jobsite in South Korea, or that Plaintiff suffered from a disability or required a reasonable accommodation.
On May 31, 2017, Plaintiff submitted a second online job application for the same Position, and thereafter emailed his résumé and cover letter to Ms. Dwyer. Plaintiff again did not mention in the online application any disability, job restrictions, or request any accommodation in connection with his second application for the Position. While Ms. Dwyer was aware that Plaintiff was injured in South Korea, there is no evidence that she was aware that he was disabled or was in need of any accommodation at the time Plaintiff was communicating with her regarding his application for the Position. On May 31, 2017, Ms. Dwyer forwarded Plaintiff's email, résumé and cover letter to Mr. Zagorski and Mr. Tylman, [*7]  recommending Plaintiff for the Position. That same day, Mr. Tylman responded and wrote: "Ellen, thanks for your recommendation. We are currently evaluating candidates and balancing the need with the workload as well as strategic hires to position us for an upcoming 'must win' project identified in Santa Ana. Might be a contingent hire based on our success with the pursuit." On June 1, 2017, Ms. Dwyer forwarded Mr. Tylman's response to Plaintiff. MBI did not obtain the contract for the OCTA highway construction project and, on June 8, 2017, cancelled the Position and ended the job search. MBI did not hire anyone for the Position.

II. Legal Standard
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) authorizes summary judgment if no genuine issue exists regarding any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The moving party must show an absence of an issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party does so, the non-moving party must go beyond the pleadings and designate specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. Id. at 324. The court does "not weigh the evidence or determine the truth of the matter, but only determines whether there is a genuine issue for trial." Balint v. Carson City, 180 F.3d 1047, 1054 (9th Cir 1999). A "'scintilla of evidence,' or evidence [*8]  that is 'merely colorable' or 'not significantly probative,'" does not present a genuine issue of material fact. United Steelworkers of Am. v. Phelps Dodge Corp., 865 F.2d 1539, 1542 (9th Cir), cert denied, 493 U.S. 809, 110 S. Ct. 51, 107 L. Ed. 2d 20 (1989) (emphasis in original, citation omitted).
The substantive law governing a claim or defense determines whether a fact is material. T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 631-32 (9th Cir 1987). The court must view the inferences drawn from the facts "in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party." Id. at 631 (citation omitted). Thus, reasonable doubts about the existence of a factual issue should be resolved against the moving party. Id. at 630-31. However, when the non-moving party's claims are factually "implausible, that party must come forward with more persuasive evidence than would otherwise be [required] . . . ." California Architectural Bldg. Prods., Inc. v. Franciscan Ceramics, Inc., 818 F.2d 1466, 1468 (9th Cir 1987), cert denied, 484 U.S. 1006, 108 S. Ct. 698, 98 L. Ed. 2d 650 (1988) (citation omitted). "No longer can it be argued that any disagreement about a material issue of fact precludes the use of summary judgment." Id. "[T]he plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S. Ct. at 2552.

III. Analysis
In its Motion for Summary Judgment, MBI [*9]  contends that Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims fail because, among other reasons, Plaintiff's generalized interest in obtaining employment with MBI is not sufficient to make him an "applicant" entitled to protection under FEHA, and that the decision makers for the one job for which Plaintiff submitted an application were not aware of Plaintiff's disability or safety complaints and therefore could not have discriminated or retaliated against him and that the cancellation of the job after MBI did not procure the OCTA project is a legitimate nondiscriminatory and nonretaliatory basis for the failure to hire.
Plaintiff's claims for disability discrimination and retaliation under FEHA require application of the three-stage burden-shifting test established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Snead v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1093 (9th Cir. 2001) (applying McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting to ADA disability discrimination claim); Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal.4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 378, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000) (applying McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting to FEHA disability discrimination claim); Brown v. City of Tucson, 336 F.3d 1181, 1186-87 (9th Cir. 2003) (applying McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting to ADA retaliation claim); Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 444, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005) (applying McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting to FEHA retaliation claim).
In applying the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, first, the plaintiff must demonstrate a prima [*10]  facie case of discrimination; second, if the plaintiff succeeds, the defendant must "articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for its actions; finally, if the defendant meets its burden, the plaintiff must demonstrate "that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination." See Texas Dept. of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 1093, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1991); McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S. Ct. at 1824, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668. "Although intermediate evidentiary burdens shift back and forth under this framework, '[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.'" Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 2106, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253, 101 S. Ct. at 1093).
The degree of proof to demonstrate a prima facie case is minimal, and does not need to rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence. Coghlan v. Am. Seafoods Co., LLC., 413 F.3d 1090, 1094 (9th Cir. 2005).
If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment decision. Although the burden of production shifts to the defendant at this point, the burden of proof remains with the plaintiff at all times. If the employer offers a nondiscriminatory reason, the burden returns to the plaintiff to show that the articulated reason [*11]  is a pretext for discrimination.
Leong v. Potter, 347 F.3d 1117, 1124 (9th Cir. 2003) (citations omitted). A plaintiff may demonstrate pretext either directly, by persuading the Court that discrimination most likely motivated the defendant, or indirectly, by showing that the defendant's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence. Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1220 (9th Cir. 1998). An explanation is considered unworthy of credence if it is internally inconsistent or otherwise not believable. Chuang v. Univ. of Cal. Davis, Bd. of Tr., 225 F.3d 1115, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000); Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 363, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 380 ("[I]n an appropriate case, an inference of dissembling may arise where the employer has given shifting, contradictory, implausible, uninformed, or factually baseless justifications for its actions."). However, bare assertions of "discriminatory motivation and intent . . . are inadequate, without substantial factual evidence, to raise an issue precluding summary judgment." Steckl v. Motorola, Inc., 703 F.2d 392, 393 (9th Cir. 1983); Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 362, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 384-85 ("[S]ummary judgment for the employer may . . . be appropriate where, given the strength of the employer's showing of innocent reasons, any countervailing circumstantial evidence of discriminatory motive, even if it may technically constitute a prima facie case, is too weak to raise a rational inference that discrimination occurred."); see also Reeves, 530 U.S. at 148 ("For instance, an employer would be entitled to judgment as a matter of law [*12]  if the record conclusively revealed some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's decision, or if the plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer's reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred."); Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 362, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 384.

A. FEHA Disability Discrimination Claim
Plaintiff contends that MBI discriminated against him in violation of FEHA because of his disability both by failing to hire him and by failing to engage in a good faith interactive process. FEHA establishes that it is an unlawful employment practice "[f]or an employer, because of the . . . physical disability . . . of any person, to refuse to hire or employ the person . . . or to bar or to discharge the person from employment . . . or to discriminate against the person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under FEHA, a plaintiff "must provide evidence that (1) he was a member of a protected class, (2) he was qualified for the position he sought or was performing competently in the position held, (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, [*13]  demotion, or denial of an available job, and (4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive." Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 379.
FEHA also provides that it is unlawful for an employer "to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). "The interactive process imposes burdens on both the employer and employee. The employee must initiate the process unless the disability and resulting limitations are obvious." Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1013, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338, 360 (2009).
It is undisputed that Plaintiff did not mention his disability in the online applications he submitted for the Position. It is also undisputed that the decision makers for the Position were not aware of Plaintiff's injury, safety complaints, disability, or work restrictions. Plaintiff, however, contends that his references to his injury in emails to Mr. Chappel and Ms. Dyer at MBI, accompanied by his stated interest in obtaining employment, and MBI's subsequent failure to hire him or engage with him to determine which of the job openings he could [*14]  perform, satisfies his burden to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination. At least where, as here, an employer publicly lists its open positions, it is not enough for a plaintiff to express a "general interest in any job" to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Smith v. J. Smith Lanier & Co., 352 F.3d 1342, 1345 (11th Cir. 2003) ("A general interest in being rehired without submitting an application is not enough to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination when the defendant-employer has publicized an open position. Here, Smith knew of vacant positions, but she chose not to apply for any of them, even though she admitted she was neither dissuaded nor prevented by management from doing so."); see also Rowell v. Sony Pictures Television Inc., 743 F. App'x 852, 854 (9th Cir. 2018) ("Inherent in the standard for retaliatory failure-to-hire is the existence of an open 'position' to which the plaintiff applied."). As in Smith, Plaintiff knew of the open positions and there is no evidence that he was dissuaded from applying for them. Instead, Plaintiff himself chose not to apply for the open positions because he thought it might weaken is chances of obtaining the job for which he submitted an application.
In these circumstances, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima [*15]  facie disability discrimination claim on either a failure to hire or failure to engage in the interactive process theory. At a minimum, because the MBI employees who made the hiring decisions did not know of Plaintiff's disability, Plaintiff has not satisfied his burden to provide any evidence that the allegedly adverse employment actions were the result of a discriminatory motive. See Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 54 n.7, 124 S. Ct. 513, 520 n.7, 157 L. Ed. 2d 357 (2003) ("If [the decision maker] were truly unaware that such a disability existed, it would be impossible for her hiring decision to have been based, even in part, on respondent's disability. And, if no part of the hiring decision turned on respondent's status as disabled, he cannot, ipso facto, have been subject to disparate treatment."). Nor is there any evidence that Plaintiff initiated the interactive process for the Position, notified MBI of his disability when he applied for the Position, or otherwise required an accommodation as part of the application process. See Atkins v. City of Los Angeles, 8 Cal. App. 5th 696, 722, 214 Cal. Rptr. 3d 113, 134 (2017) ("FEHA requires reassignment as a reasonable accommodation for employees, but not applicants.").
Finally, even if Plaintiff had satisfied his burden to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, MBI has established a legitimate [*16]  nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. Specifically, the Position for which Plaintiff submitted an application was not filled, and the job cancelled, because MBI did not receive the OCTA project. Plaintiff's efforts to create a triable issue of fact concerning pretext are "unavailing" because, in judging whether an employer's "proffered justification were 'false,' it is not important whether they were objectively false . . . . Rather, courts 'only require that an employer honestly believed its reason for its actions, even if its reason is 'foolish or trivial or even baseless.'" Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1063 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting Johnson v. Nordstrom, Inc., 260 F.3d 727, 733 (7th Cir. 2001)).

B. Retaliation Claims
Plaintiff also asserts that MBI's failure to hire him violates the anti-retaliation provisions of FEHA, California Labor Code sections 6310 and 6400, and California public policy. To establish a prima facie case of FEHA retaliation, "the plaintiff must show he or she engaged in a 'protected activity,' the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." McRae v. Dep't of Corr. & Rehab., 142 Cal. App. 4th 377, 386, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 313, 319 (2006); see also Ruggles v. Cal. Polytechnic State Univ., 797 F.2d 782, 786 (9th Cir. 1986) (holding that "in the failure-to-hire retaliation context involving a claim of retaliation, the plaintiff meets her prima facie burden by showing that [*17]  1) she engaged in protected activity, 2) the position was eliminated as to her, and 3) the position was eliminated as to her because of the protected activity").
FEHA specifically prohibits an employer from discriminating against "any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h). The "practices forbidden under this part" and proceedings "under this part" refers to the discriminatory employment practices prohibited by FEHA, rather than the safety-related concerns Plaintiff expressed. As a result, Plaintiff has not engaged in a "protected activity" for purposes of a FEHA retaliation claim. Additionally, for the same reasons that Plaintiff was unable to show that MBI's cancellation of the job was pretextual, that is, it was cancelled because MBI did not procure the OCTA project MBI, Plaintiff fails to create a triable issue of fact that MBI's failure to hire Plaintiff was "because of" any protected activity.
Plaintiff also contends that MBI violated the anti-retaliation provisions of California Labor Code sections 6310 and 6400. California Labor Code section 6310 provides:
(a) No person shall discharge or in any manner discriminate [*18]  against any employee because the employee has done any of the following:
(1) Made any oral or written complaint to the division, other governmental agencies having statutory responsibility for or assisting the division with reference to employee safety or health, his or her employer, or his or her representative.
(2) Instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or relating to his or her rights or has testified or is about to testify in the proceeding or because of the exercise by the employee on behalf of himself, herself, or others of any rights afforded him or her.
(3) Participated in an occupational health and safety committee established pursuant to Section 6401.7.
(4) Reported a work-related fatality, injury, or illness, requested access to occupational injury or illness reports and records that are made or maintained pursuant to Subchapter 1 (commencing with Section 14000) of Chapter 1 of Division 1 of Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations, or exercised any other rights protected by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 651 et seq.) . . . .
Cal. Labor Code § 6310(a). California Labor Code section 6400(a) provides that "[e]very employer shall furnish employment and a place of employment that is safe and healthful for the employees therein."
Although [*19]  MBI has asserted that Plaintiff's retaliation claims, whether asserted pursuant to Labor Code sections 6310 and 6400, or as a violation of California public policy, fail because MBI was never Plaintiff's employer, the Ninth Circuit has concluded that California Labor Code section 6310(a) allows an "action for retaliatory discharge against a subsequent employer." Skillsky v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 893 F.2d 1088, 1094 (9th Cir. 1990). Nevertheless, because, as the Court has already concluded, Plaintiff has not established even a triable issue of fact that MBI retaliated against Plaintiff "because of" the safety concerns he raised, Plaintiff's Labor Code and public policy claims also fail.2 See Cuevas v. SkyWest Airlines, 17 F. Supp. 3d 956, 963-67 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (granting summary judgment on California Labor Code section 6310 and public policy claims because of the employer's legitimate non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action); see also Stevenson v. Superior Court, 16 Cal. 4th 880, 904, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 888, 903, 941 P.2d 1157 (1997) ("[W]hen a plaintiff relies upon a statutory prohibition to support a common law cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy, the common law claim is subject to statutory limitations affecting the nature and scope of the statutory prohibition . . . .").

C. Punitive Damages
MBI also seeks summary judgment on Plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages. Because MBI is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's substantive claims, Plaintiff [*20]  may not recover punitive damages. See Hilliard v. A. H. Robins Co., 148 Cal. App. 3d 374, 391, 196 Cal. Rptr. 117, 127-28 (1983) ("There is no cause of action for punitive damages. Punitive or exemplary damages are remedies available to a party who can plead and prove the facts and circumstances set forth in Civil Code section 3294 . . . . 'Punitive damages are merely incident to a cause of action, and can never constitute the basis thereof.'") (quoting Gold v. Los Angeles Democratic League, 49 Cal. App. 3d 365, 373, n.3, 122 Cal. Rptr. 732, 738 n.3 (1975)).
The Court additionally concludes, as a matter of law, that Plaintiff has failed to create even a triable issue of fact that MBI, by "clear and convincing evidence" acted with the required "oppression, fraud, or malice" to support an award of punitive damages. Cal. Civ. Code § 3294; see also In re First Alliance Mortg. Co., 471 F.3d 977, 998 (9th Cir. 2006) ("The district court found that the [plaintiff] could not prove any facts that could meet the burden of evidence that [defendant's] conduct amounted to fraud, malice or oppression under California punitive damages law, and we conclude that the district court did not err in making this determination.").

D. Evidentiary Issues
In his Opposition, Plaintiff includes a footnote in which he complains about the timing of MBI's production of an email after "most of the depositions had been taken" and claims that he was "prevented from thoroughly investigating" the email "with [*21]  most MBI witnesses." Plaintiff states: "Under Rule 56 Atef should be allowed additional discovery to remedy this injustice caused by MBI conduct in violation of the discovery rules." (Opp'n at 8 n.1.) The Court construes this as a request for a continuance pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d). Under Rule 56(d), the Court has discretion to extend a response deadline where "the nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition." Accordingly, to meet its burden under Rule 56(d), the non-moving party must show: "(1) it has set forth in affidavit form the specific facts it hopes to elicit from further discovery; (2) that the facts sought exist; and (3) that the sought-after facts are essential to oppose summary judgment." Family Home & Fin. Ctr., Inc. v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp., 525 F.3d 822, 827 (9th Cir. 2008). An extension is not justified merely because discovery is incomplete or desired facts are unavailable. See Jensen v. Redev. Agency of Sandy City, 998 F.2d 1550, 1554 (10th Cir. 1993). Rather, "the party filing the affidavit must show how additional time will enable him to rebut the movant's allegations of no genuine issue of fact." Id. "[T]he party seeking a continuance bears the burden to show what specific facts it hopes to discover that will raise an issue of material fact." Continental Maritime v. Pacific Coast Metal Trades, 817 F.2d 1391, 1395 (9th Cir. 1987). "The burden is on the party seeking [*22]  additional discovery to proffer sufficient facts to show that the evidence sought exists, and that it would prevent summary judgment." Chance v. Pac-Tel. Teletrac, Inc., 242 F.3d 1151, 1161 n.6 (9th Cir. 2001).
Plaintiff has not met his burden to justify a Rule 56(d) continuance. Specifically, Plaintiff's request for a continuance is not supported by the required affidavit, Plaintiff does not attempt to meet, much less satisfy, his burden to identify the particular facts he seeks, that they exist, or how they are necessary to prevent summary judgment. The Court therefore denies Plaintiff's request for a continuance pursuant to Rule 56(d).
The Court also notes that MBI objected in its Reply to the Declaration of Plaintiff filed in support of Plaintiff's Opposition because Plaintiff's Declaration was not signed as required by 28 U.S.C. § 1746. Despite MBI having raised Plaintiff's failure to sign and date his Declaration, Plaintiff made no effort to correct his failure to comply with 28 U.S.C. § 1746. The Court has reviewed Plaintiff's Declaration. None of the facts contained in it would alter the Court's conclusions even if the Declaration did comply with 28 U.S.C. § 1746.

Conclusion
For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that MBI is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's discrimination, retaliation, and public [*23]  policy claims. The Court therefore grants MBI's Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court will issue a Judgment consistent with this Order.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
JUDGMENT
Pursuant to the Court's June 15, 2020 Minute Order granting the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by defendant Michael Baker International, Inc. ("Defendant"), which granted summary judgment to Defendant on the claims asserted by plaintiff Atef Elzeftawy ("Plaintiff"),
