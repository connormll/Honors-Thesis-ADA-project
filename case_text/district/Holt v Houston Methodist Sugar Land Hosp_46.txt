REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS
Plaintiff Chaunetta Holt brings this suit pro se against Defendant Houston Methodist Sugar Land Hospital, her former employer, for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and for defamation under Texas state law. Now pending before the Court is Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's third amended complaint, ECF No. 36.1 Based on a careful review of the pleadings, briefs, and arguments of Plaintiff and Defendant's counsel, the Court RECOMMENDS that the motion be DENIED with respect to Plaintiff's ADA claims and GRANTED with respect to her defamation claim.

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff worked in the telemetry lab at Houston Methodist Sugar Land Hospital, where her duties included monitoring patients' respiration and electrocardiogram readings. In her third amended complaint, ECF No. 31, Plaintiff alleges, inter alia, that: she "ha[s] a disability that [*2]  required [her] to have surgery"; that her "disabilities pertain to . . . [r]eproductive [p]roblems . . . [involving] tumors, prolapsed uterus, incontinence and [c]ircuitry [sic]," and a "[b]lood clotting disorder;" on March 13, 2017, she discussed her reproductive problems with her supervisor, Jennifer Pazderny; for several months preceding her termination, Defendant subjected her to a hostile work environment by critiquing her work "with a raised level of scrutiny [as compared to the level of scrutiny applied to] similarly situated employees" and by making false claims against her in order "to create a pretext for [her] termination;" on July 27, 2017, Pazderny texted Plaintiff's cell phone with the message "Too young to have all these Problems!!!" in reference to Plaintiff's reproductive problems; on August 11, 2017, Plaintiff notified Pazderny that her medical conditions "would require [her] to take time off for surgery"; and later that same day, Plaintiff was wrongfully terminated "as a result of [her] disability" and "in retaliation," all in violation of the ADA. ECF No. 31 at 2-7.
Plaintiff also asserts a claim against Defendant for defamation under Texas state law. ECF No. 31 [*3]  at 4. In her third amended complaint, she alleges that "[f]alse claims w[ere] made against [her]" before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Texas Workforce Commission. Id. at 8. In subsequent documents filed with the Court, and at a hearing held by the Court in connection with the motion to dismiss, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant defamed her character by stating to the EEOC on April 30, 2018, and to the Texas Workforce Commission during the last of seven hearings held before a hearing officer, that "because Plaintiff carries a purse [at the workplace], . . . she may have a gun" and was a "security threat." E.g., ECF No. 61 at 18, 20-21; ECF No. 44 at 9-10.2 Plaintiff maintains that Defendant's statement was completely false, she did not have a gun, Defendant did not see a gun, and Defendant does not have a policy which prohibited her from carrying a purse at the workplace. Id.

LEGAL STANDARD
Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for dismissal of a complaint which "fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." Motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) are viewed with disfavor and are rarely granted. Shaikh v. Texas A&M Univ. Coll. of Med., 739 F. App'x 215, 218 (5th Cir. 2018) (quoting Leal v. McHugh, 731 F.3d 405, 410 (5th Cir. 2013)). When deciding a motion to dismiss, a court must construe the complaint liberally in favor of the [*4]  plaintiff. United States ex rel. Rafizadeh v. Cont'l Common, Inc., 553 F.3d 869, 872 (5th Cir. 2008). All well-pleaded factual allegations must be taken as true, id., and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from those allegations must be indulged in favor of the plaintiff, Ryals v. El Paso Cty., 630 F. App'x 332, 333 (5th Cir. 2016). "[T]he burden is on the moving party to prove that no legally cognizable claim for relief exists." Constr. Cost Data, LLC v. Gordian Grp., Inc., No. 4:16-cv-114, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77481, 2017 WL 2266993, at *3 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 24, 2017) (quoting 5B Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 1357 (3d ed. 2017)), report and recommendation adopted, 2017 WL 2271491 (S.D. Tex. May 22, 2017); accord In re Paracelsus Corp., 6 F. Supp. 2d 626, 630 (S.D. Tex. 1998).
The Supreme Court has interpreted Rule 8(a)(2)'s requirement that a complaint contain "a short and plain statement of the claim[s] showing that the pleader is entitled to relief" as authorizing dismissal of a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) if the complaint does not "contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). It does not take much for a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss based upon an Iqbal/Twombly "plausibility" argument. The factual allegations in the complaint do not need to be "detailed," id. at 678; they must merely "be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are [*5]  true (even if doubtful in fact)," Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citations omitted); see also In re Southern Scrap Material Co., 541 F.3d 584, 587 (5th Cir. 2008) ("This standard 'simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of' the necessary claims or elements." (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556)).
In ruling on the motion to dismiss in the present case, the Court must also take cognizance of the fact that Plaintiff is proceeding without the aid of counsel. "A document filed pro se is to be liberally construed, and a pro se complaint, however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers." Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976)); accord Fed. Exp. Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 U.S. 389, 402, 128 S. Ct. 1147, 170 L. Ed. 2d 10 (2008) ("Even in the formal litigation context, pro se litigants are held to a lesser pleading standard than other parties."); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(e) ("Pleadings must be construed so as to do justice."). "[I]f the court can reasonably read [a pro se litigant's] pleadings to state a valid claim on which the plaintiff could prevail, it should do so despite the plaintiff's failure to cite proper legal authority, his confusion of various legal theories, his poor syntax and sentence construction, or his unfamiliarity with pleading requirements." Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991); accord Howard v. King, 707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir. 1983); Franklin v. Rose, 765 F.2d 82, 85 (6th Cir. 1985) ("The appropriate liberal construction requires active interpretation [*6]  in some cases to construe a pro se petition 'to encompass any allegation stating federal relief.'" (quoting White v. Wyrick, 530 F.2d 818, 819 (8th Cir. 1976))). In addition, the requirement that courts liberally construe pro se pleadings and afford the pro se plaintiff the benefit of any doubt applies with particular force in cases involving civil rights claims, which include claims under disability rights statutes such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. Hebbe v. Pliler, 627 F.3d 338, 342 (9th Cir. 2010); Sause v. Bauer, 138 S. Ct. 2561, 2563, 201 L. Ed. 2d 982 (2018).

DISCUSSION

1. Plaintiff has stated a claim for employment discrimination under the ADA.
Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act makes it unlawful for any covered entity to "discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Against Plaintiff's claim that Defendant violated this provision when it fired her, Defendant presses a number of arguments, all without merit.

a. Plaintiff has adequately alleged that she has a disability.
Defendant first argues that Plaintiff has not adequately alleged that she has a "disability." ECF No. 36 at 3-5. The ADA defines the term [*7]  "disability" to include: (1) "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual"; (2) "a record of such an impairment"; and (3) "being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A)-(C). A "physical or mental impairment" includes "[a]ny physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more body systems, such as neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, immune, circulatory, hemic, lymphatic, skin, and endocrine." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(h)(1). "Major life activities" include "the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(B). "Major life activities" also "include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." Id. § 12102(2)(A). Lest there be any doubt [*8]  concerning the immense breadth of these definitions, the ADA expressly mandates that "[t]he definition of disability . . . be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals . . . to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of [the statute]." Id. § 12102(4)(A); accord Shaikh, 739 F. App'x at 219.
The allegations in Plaintiff's third amended complaint satisfy the ADA's expansive definition of "disability." Plaintiff's complaint states that her disabilities pertain to "reproductive problems," namely, "tumors, prolapsed uterus, incontinence and [c]ircuitry," and to a "blood clotting disorder." ECF No. 31 at 6. These allegations meet the definition of "disability" and are sufficient to plausibly indicate that Plaintiff had "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities." In particular, the allegations demonstrate that Plaintiff suffered from one or more "physiological disorder[s] or condition[s] . . . affecting one or more body systems, such as . . . cardiovascular, reproductive, . . . genitourinary, immune, circulatory, [and/or] hemic." The allegation that Plaintiff suffered from "tumors" involving her "reproductive [system]" is sufficient to show that her condition(s) limited [*9]  the "major life activities" of "normal cell growth" and "reproductive functions." See, e.g., Neoplasm, Stedmans Medical Dictionary (defining the term "neoplasm," which is a technical medical term for "tumor," as: "An abnormal tissue that grows by cellular proliferation more rapidly than normal and continues to grow after the stimuli that initiated the new growth cease. Neoplasms show partial or complete lack of structural organization and functional coordination with the normal tissue, and usually form a distinct mass of tissue that may be either benign (benign tumor) or malignant (cancer)."). The allegation that Plaintiff suffered from a "prolapsed uterus," as well as "incontinence and [c]ircuitry" problems related to her reproductive system is sufficient to show that her condition(s) limited the "major life activit[y]" of "reproductive functions." The allegation that Plaintiff suffered from a "blood clotting disorder" is sufficient to show that her condition(s) limited the "major life activit[y]" of "circulatory functions."

b. Plaintiff has adequately alleged that her disability substantially limits one or more major life activities.
Defendant complains that Plaintiff "does not state [*10]  how [her] conditions substantially limits [sic] any major life activity." ECF No. 36 at 5. Like the term "disability," the phrase "substantially limits" must be "construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA," and "is not meant to be a demanding standard." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i); accord id. § 1630.2(j)(1)(iii) ("The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether covered entities have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether an individual's impairment substantially limits a major life activity.").
Plaintiff's allegations concerning her conditions, especially her allegation that she received medical attention in connection with those conditions and that she required further medical treatment up to and including surgery, are sufficient to conclude that the condition(s) "substantially limit" major life activities including normal cell growth and Plaintiff's circulatory and reproductive functions. As the regulations state:
An impairment is a disability within the meaning of this section if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people [*11]  in the general population. An impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). Manifestly, "most people in the general population" do not have tumors in their reproductive systems, least of all tumors that require medical attention up to and including surgery. Thus, taking Plaintiff's allegation that she suffered from tumors in her reproductive system that required such medical attention as true, it is plausible that those tumors "substantially limited" Plaintiff's "major life activity" of "normal cell growth." The same analysis applies to Plaintiff's allegation that she also suffered from a "prolapsed uterus, incontinence and [c]ircuitry," and a "blood clotting disorder." In this Court's experience, most people in the general population do not suffer from any of these ailments, let alone all of them simultaneously. Similarly, most people in the general population do not require medical attention or medical treatment including surgery, as Plaintiff does. Consequently, taking Plaintiff's allegations as true, it is plausible that these conditions "substantially limited" [*12]  Plaintiff's "major life activities" in the sense that they limited her "reproductive functions" and "circulatory functions" substantially in comparison to most people in the general population.
Consider Donaldson v. Trae-Fuels, LLC, No. 3:18-cv-00097, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 209734, 2019 WL 6646735 (W.D. Va. Dec. 5, 2019), a case in which a plaintiff claimed that his employer violated the ADA when it fired him because of his disability. The plaintiff "claim[ed] that he was actually disabled . . . since his pancreatic cancer was a physical limitation that substantially limited his major bodily functions regarding his normal cell growth and his digestive functions," 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 209734 at [WL]*8 (internal quotation marks omitted). Noting that "[t]he question of whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis," id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), the court readily concluded that the plaintiff met the ADA's definition of "disabled." Explaining that the plaintiff, in response to Defendant's motion for summary judgment, had presented evidence of his condition and that "he was required to undergo chemotherapy treatment," the court held that "[i]n light of such evidence . . . a reasonable jury could easily find that [the [*13]  plaintiff] had a physical impairment that substantially limited one or more major life activities." Id. Although the summary judgment evidentiary standard does not apply here, the Donaldson court's decision recognizes that when a condition requires medical treatment (chemotherapy in Donaldson, surgery in the present case), it satisfies the "substantially limits" requirement.
This conclusion also follows from basic common sense. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 ("Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief . . . [is] a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense."). Most people in the general population do not seek medical treatment or undergo surgery needlessly. Thus, taking Plaintiff's allegation that her condition(s) required her to seek out and obtain medical attention and to undergo surgery, and indulging all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor, it is plausible that her condition(s) "substantially limited" one or more of her major life activities.
Defendant cites Dutcher v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, 53 F.3d 723, 726 (5th Cir. 1995), but Congress abrogated the Fifth Circuit's narrow analysis of the ADA's "major life activities" and "substantially limits" requirements in that case when [*14]  it passed the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553. Moreover, "as along as an impairment substantially limits one major life activity, such as normal cell growth, it need not limit other major life activities, such as working, in order to be considered a disability." Donaldson, 2019 WL 6646735, at *8 (quoting Norton v. Assisted Living Concepts, Inc., 786 F. Supp. 2d 1173, 1185 (E.D. Tex. 2011)).
Defendant next suggests that Plaintiff was required to provide a detailed explanation of "how" her reproductive disorder "substantially limited" the functioning of her reproductive and/or circulatory systems. On the contrary, all Plaintiff was required to do was allege enough facts from which it can be reasonably inferred "that" her condition substantially limits one or more major life activities, 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A), and she has done just that. A plaintiff claiming discrimination under the ADA is not required to delineate in precise detail the mechanism(s) underlying her impairment in her complaint. Rule 8(a)(2) requires a "short and plain statement" of a plaintiff's claims, not a lengthy medical report detailing every aspect of her condition.

c. Plaintiff has adequately alleged that she was qualified for her position.
Defendant contends that Plaintiff's complaint is deficient because she "failed to allege facts regarding how she was otherwise qualified for her position." [*15]  ECF No. 36 at 5 (emphasis added). Plaintiff has adequately alleged that she was qualified.
The ADA defines a "qualified individual" as "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Regulations provide detailed guidance regarding the terms "qualified," "essential functions," and "reasonable accommodation," 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(m)-(o), but close examination of those regulatory intricacies is unnecessary at this stage. It is enough that Plaintiff alleges that she was hired by Defendant, she worked for Defendant for a period of time, and she was fired only after she indicated that she would need to take time off from work so that she could undergo surgery. Those allegations exceed the minimum threshold for plausibly indicating that she was "qualified" for her position. Shaikh, 739 F. App'x at 220-21 & nn.4-6. To conclude otherwise—that is, to conclude that these allegations are not sufficient to satisfy the Iqbal/Twombly plausibility standard as it pertains to the ADA's "qualified individual" requirement—this Court would have to assume that Defendant routinely hires unqualified individuals to perform important medical tests [*16]  on its patients. At this stage, the Court must indulge all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiff, and that requires the Court to assume that Defendant generally hires qualified individuals to work at its hospital.

d. Under the more liberal pleading standards for pro se parties, Plaintiff has satisfied Rule 8(a).
Applying the more liberal construction of pro se pleadings, the case for denying Defendant's motion would be even stronger. For example, in her responses to Defendant's motion, ECF Nos. 37-38, Plaintiff gives further details about her disorders, all of which support the conclusion that she meets the ADA's requirements:
Disorder of Circulatory system is a disability. Blood if the red fluid circulating in the arteries, veins, and capillaries, providing nourishment and oxygen to body tissue and taking away product of metabolism . . . The hyper coagulation necrosis induce loss [of] arterial blood supply to tissue [including] heart muscle, kidney, liver, and adrenal glands. . . . Necrosis is the total morphologic changes that follow irreversible injury and death of cells in a circumscribe[d] are[a] of living tissue and organs. Avascular necrosis caused by deficient blood supply may occur [*17]  anywhere in the body . . . . The organs . . . in the body not receiving suffic[i]e[nt] blood cause irreversible injury.
. . . Defendant was aware of . . . Plaintiff['s] blood disorder. Defendant was aware that the Plaintiff was hav[ing] numbness of the limbs, chest pain, hypercoagulation. Plaintiff['s] disability substantially [a]ffect[s] life activities by way of limbs walking leg pain for lack of blood flow . . . and internal major organs (heart — chest pains, kidney-bladder-incontinence, reproductive area—uterus—prolapse—tumors) Plaintiff is in daily pain. Plaintiff was hospitalized for chest pains Methodist Hospital, r/o stroke Herman Hospital. . . .
. . . leiomyoma occurring in the uterine wall. Theuteruswith leiomyomatosis (Tumors) in Endometrial the wall on and top of the uterus . . . Plaintiff in pain daily has it negative impact [a]ffects quality of life.
ECF No. 38 at 3-5.
In sum, the various arguments Defendant puts forth for dismissing Plaintiff's ADA discrimination claim must be rejected because they do not comport with the statute or with federal pleading requirements. Furthermore, since Plaintiff has adequately alleged that she actually had a disability, it is unnecessary [*18]  for the Court to determine at this juncture whether she has also alleged sufficient facts to satisfy the "record of a disability" and/or the "regarded as" prongs of the ADA's definition of "disability."

2. Plaintiff has also stated a claim for retaliation under the ADA.
The ADA's anti-retaliation provision states in relevant part:
No person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter.
42 U.S.C. § 12203(a).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim under this provision (1) because she has not alleged that she engaged in a "protected activity" under the ADA, and (2) because she has not alleged a "causal connection" between the protected activity and her termination. See ECF No. 36 at 6. Defendant is wrong on both counts.
Plaintiff alleges that she was terminated the very same day she notified her supervisor that her medical condition(s) would require her to take time off from work for surgery. It is well established that requesting an accommodation is protected [*19]  activity for purposes of the ADA's anti-retaliation provision. Wright v. CompUSA, Inc., 352 F.3d 472, 477-78 (1st Cir. 2003); accord Floyd v. Lee, 968 F. Supp. 2d 308, 331-32 (D.D.C. 2013) (citing cases from the First, Third, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits, and observing that "no circuit has held the contrary"); see also Alfaro v. Comm'r, 349 F.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir. 2003) (stating that the Fifth Circuit is "always chary to create a circuit split").3
Defendant's complaint as to the (in)formality of Plaintiff's request is without merit. A request for a reasonable accommodation "does not require the disabled individual to have 'appl[ied] formally' for an accommodation." Shaikh, 739 F. App'x at 221 n.7 (citing EEOC v. Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., 570 F.3d 606, 621-22 (5th Cir. 2009), and Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., 184 F.3d 296, 313-14 (3d Cir. 1999)). Even if Plaintiff's request somehow fell short when considered in isolation from all other facts alleged, those additional allegations, especially those regarding Pazderny's awareness of, and previous comments about, her disabilities, demonstrate sufficient awareness on Defendant's part of Plaintiff's health situation as to render plausible her retaliation claim. Furthermore, under the facts alleged, Plaintiff did not have a reasonable opportunity to make a formal accommodation request because Defendant fired her within hours of her giving notice that she would need time off from work so she could undergo surgery. Cutrera v. Bd. of Supervisors of La. St. Univ., 429 F.3d 108, 113 (5th Cir. 2005) ("An employer may [*20]  not stymie the interactive process of identifying a reasonable accommodation for an employee's disability by preemptively terminating the employee before an accommodation can be considered or recommended."); accord Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., 570 F.3d at 621 ("When an employer does not engage in a good faith interactive process, that employer violates the ADA—including when the employer discharges the employee instead of considering the requested accommodations."). That leads to the next point.
Even if the Court were to disregard the foregoing analysis and instead embrace an impermissibly narrow interpretation of the ADA's protected activity and reasonable accommodation provisions, it would still be required to find Plaintiff's retaliation claim actionable. By firing Plaintiff within hours of notification to her supervisor that her medical condition(s) would potentially require time off from work for surgery, Defendant took a preemptive strike against Plaintiff, which prevented her from engaging in protected activity. As courts have long recognized, "[a]ction taken against an individual in anticipation of that person engaging in protected [activity] is no less retaliatory than action taken after the fact." Sauers v. Salt Lake Cty., 1 F.3d 1122, 1128 (10th Cir. 1993) (so holding in a [*21]  case involving Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), the text of which is virtually identical to the ADA's anti-retaliation provision); accord Heuer v. Weil-McLain, 203 F.3d 1021, 1023 (7th Cir. 2000) (explaining that "the very purpose of the anti-retaliation provision is to prevent . . . claims from being deterred" and further holding that "efforts to deter or prevent the filing of a claim can be actionable even if they take forms other than firing or demotion or other job action"); Beckel v. Wal-Mart Assoc., Inc., 301 F.3d 621, 624 (7th Cir. 2002) (recognizing, per Judge Posner, that an employer's threat to fire a plaintiff if she sued "would be a form of anticipatory retaliation, actionable as retaliation under Title VII"); EEOC v. Bojangles Rests., Inc., 284 F. Supp. 2d 320, 328 (M.D.N.C. 2003) (holding that Title VII's anti-retaliation clause covers preemptive employer actions and precludes employers from discriminating against employees it fears will later engage in protected activity). To hold otherwise would severely undermine Congress's purpose in enacting the ADA's anti-retaliation provision, not only by creating a safe harbor that nefarious employers will doubtlessly exploit with impunity, but also by "provid[ing] a perverse incentive for employers to fire employees who might [engage in protected activity in the future]," Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 346, 117 S. Ct. 843, 136 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1997) (emphasis added). It is difficult to image any judicial construction [*22]  that would more readily turn the ADA's anti-retaliation provision into a dead letter than for this Court to rule preemptive or anticipatory retaliation unactionable.
Finally, Defendant's contention that "Plaintiff fails to allege any causal connection between the protected activity and her termination," ECF No. 36 at 6, fails to carry its burden as the movant. The timing of Plaintiff's discharge alone is suspect—coming as it did within hours of her giving notice to her direct supervisor that she would need time off from work for surgery due to her health conditions—and becomes even more so in light of Pazderny's past comments regarding Plaintiff's condition.4 These facts are enough to plausibly allege a causal connection at this stage. See Branch v. City of Brookshire-Texas-Brookshire Police Dep't, No. 4:16-cv-1888, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149661, 2017 WL 4100009, at *3 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 15, 2017) ("Based on the pleadings, [the plaintiff] suffered from an adverse employment decision less than a month after engaging in a protected activity. This is sufficiently close to satisfy the causal connection. Accordingly, [the plaintiff]'s claim for retaliation is facially plausible and the motion to dismiss the claim is DENIED.").

3. Plaintiff's defamation claim should be dismissed [*23]  based on Judge Atlas' previous order.
A claim for defamation under Texas law involves a multiplicity of issues that cannot easily be compiled into a rigid formula. In general, however, the elements of a claim for defamation under Texas law include: "(1) the publication of a false statement of fact to a third party, (2) that was defamatory concerning the plaintiff, (3) with the requisite degree of fault, and (4) damages, in some cases." In re Lipsky, 460 S.W.3d 579, 593 (Tex. 2015).
Plaintiff's third amended complaint states generally that "[f]alse claims w[ere] made against [her]" before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Texas Workforce Commission, ECF No. 31 at 8, but provides no additional factual content bearing upon her defamation claim. That is problematic because Judge Atlas previously dismissed Plaintiff's defamation claim and expressly stated that Plaintiff needed to "allege specific facts in her [c]omplaint about what exactly was said that she claims was defamatory and the circumstances of the statements, such as who made the statements, where and when the statements were made, and who heard or saw the statements." ECF No. 16 at 10. Plaintiff failed to do so. Accordingly, the Court must recommend that [*24]  the motion to dismiss be granted with respect to Plaintiff's defamation claim.5

CONCLUSION
The Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion to dismiss be DENIED with respect to Plaintiff's ADA claims and GRANTED with respect to her defamation claim.
The parties have fourteen days from service of this Report and Recommendation to file written objections. 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b). Failure to file timely objections will preclude appellate review of factual findings and legal conclusions, except for plain error. Ortiz v. City of San Antonio Fire Dep't, 806 F.3d 822, 825 (5th Cir. 2015).
