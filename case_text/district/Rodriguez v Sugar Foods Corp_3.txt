ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Fidel Rodriguez filed this action on March 7, 2014, against Sugar Foods Corporation ("Sugar Foods") and various fictitious defendants.1 Sugar Foods removed the action to this court on May 6, 2014, invoking the court's diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332.2 On February 23, 2015, it filed a motion for summary judgment.3 Rodriguez opposes the motion.4

I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Sugar Foods markets and distributes a product line of sweeteners, non-dairy creamers, salad toppings, stuffing, and other snack foods.5 It operates a bakery facility in Commerce, California that manufactures and packs croutons and other "crunchy toppings." [*2] 6 Rodriguez was employed as a forklift driver at Sugar Foods' Commerce facility. He allegedly began working for Sugar Foods in July 2011.7 He was initially employed through AMR, a temp agency.8 He became a direct employee of Sugar Foods on October 11, 2011.9
Rodriguez contends that on Friday January 6, 2012, "close to the end of [his] shift" he sustained an injury to his back.10 Rodriguez reported the injury to his supervisor, David Alaya, informing him that his "back was hurting a lot because of the forklift."11 With approximately 30 minutes remaining in Rodriguez's shift, Alaya purportedly told Rodriguez he could go home early if he wanted to do so, but that he would need a doctor's note.12 Rodriguez contends he "thought about it," but decided against it because of "medical expenses, [and] stuff like that."13 Instead, he decided to finish his shift and rest.14 Rodriguez never returned to work at Sugar Foods following the January 6, 2012 incident.15
Rodriguez complained of pain to his wife and family throughout the weekend that followed. He asserts he "couldn't move."16 On the evening of January 8, 2012, Rodriguez went to the emergency room at Mission Hospital because of pain and inability [*3]  to move.17 After reviewing an X-ray taken at the hospital, Rodriguez was given a doctor's note stating that he "need[ed] to take some days off" because "[t]here[ was] something abnormal."18 On January 10, 2012, Rodriguez went to see his primary care physician, Dr. David Brown, who prescribed Naprosyn and ibuprofen, both of which are painkillers, for his pain and muscle spasms.19 Dr. Brown told Rodriguez he believed the injury was work-related, and advised him to inform Sugar Foods.20 Ronald Grijalva, Sugar Foods' Human Resources Manager, states that he learned on January 18, 2012 that Rodriguez had sustained a workplace injury; he arranged that day for Rodriguez to be seen by a physician at U.S. Healthworks.21 The parties do not dispute that Rodriguez filed a worker's compensation claim the same day.22
Following his January 18, 2012 appointment at U.S. Healthworks, Rodriguez was given a shift off work and advised to return to U.S. Healthworks the following day for a follow-up examination.23 Rodriguez returned on January 19, 2012; Dr. Tien-Hoa Ko advised him that he could return to work with a sit-down job and modified duty for three days.24 Rodriguez contends that thereafter, he had [*4]  a conversation with someone at Sugar Foods named David; the individual with whom he spoke was not David Alaya. Rodriguez testified at his deposition that he told David he could not work; he described the conversation as follows:
"Q. Okay. [W]hat did David say?
A. He said, Listen, Fidel, I got the information - I don't know if it was on the 19th or the 20th. I got the information from - I don't know where he got it from. He said, It says you can come back to work but with limitations and stuff. So are you going to make it in? And I told him, I don't know, I don't know, David. [Then he said b]ut it says in the paper that you can. And I told him, That's what the paper says, you know. I don't feel like I can come back - come into work. And he says, How about - how about you call me later and see if you feel better. If not, just call off. [And I said,] All right. And then that's what - that happened. I did call up later and called off."25
Rodriguez admitted that Sugar Foods, through David, offered to accommodate the restrictions that Dr. Ko imposed in connection with a return to work, but said he felt he could not work:
"Q. Okay. So basically he said they were going to accommodate your restrictions [*5]  that you were given by U.S . HealthWorks?
A. Yes. They told me they were going to do that.
Q. Okay. And do you remember anything else about that conversation?
A. I remember telling him that I couldn't do that, that I was even on the bed as we were speaking."26
Rodriguez's inability to work was confirmed, at least in part, when he returned to U.S. Healthworks on January 23, 2012, and saw Dr. Jesus Mendoza; during this visit, he was given two days off work and advised to return to U.S. Healthworks on January 25, 2012.27 On January 25, 2012, he returned, and saw physician assistant Natasha Wright.28 Rodriguez was told that he could return to work that day, but with certain restrictions - namely, no stooping and bending, no kneeing or squatting, no driving a company vehicle, and limited lifting, pulling, or pushing up to 10 pounds.29 He was told to perform a "[s]it down job."30 Rodriguez contends that Wright told him that "there was something wrong with him" and that he "needed a second opinion."31 A work status report dated the same day indicates that Rodriguez was scheduled to begin physical therapy on January 30, 2012.32 Dr. Mendoza directed that Rodriguez return for further evaluation on February [*6]  1, 2012.33 There apparently were additional evaluations scheduled for February 8 and 16, 2012; although Rodriguez asserts he was unaware of them, it is undisputed that he did not attend.34 He contends he did not do so because he had gone to stay with his mother in San Diego on February 1, 2012; he also asserts he had advised Grijalva of this fact.35 He states that he told Grijalva there was a U.S. Healthworks "down the street from where [he] lived."36 Rodriguez asked Grijalva whether he could go to that location. Grijalva said that he was "going to have to get back [to Rodriguez on] that," but never did so.37
Grijalva contends he had two conversations with Rodriguez concerning his obligation to update his supervisors - Louis Avila, David Alaya, and Jerry Palomera - on his work status.38 As evidenced by an email Grijalva sent Amanda Barnum at UC Advantage,39 one of these conversations took place on February 3, 2012, by telephone.40 The email recounts the fact that Rodriguez told Grijalva he needed to have unspecified documents faxed to him so he could apply for military benefits. Grijalva states he asked Rodriguez why he was not making medical appointments and/or [*7]  communicating with his supervisor. The email is somewhat inconsistent in that it states first that Rodriguez told Grijalva "he had moved to San Diego to live with his mother";41 this appears to indicate that Rodriguez had already relocated permanently. It then states Grijalva told Rodriguez that if he failed to communicate with his supervisor, it would be considered job abandonment, and asked "if [he] preferred to resign since he was looking at living in San Diego";42 this suggests Rodriguez had not yet decided to relocate permanently. Rodriguez allegedly said he would think about it and get back to Grijalva.43
On February 6, 2012, Grijalva mailed a letter to Rodriguez at his last known address in Los Angeles County.44 The letter outlined the conversations in which Grijalva told Rodriguez he had to advise supervisors of his work status, and stated that none of the supervisors had heard from him. "[B]ecause of the delicate situation of [Rodriguez's] reported injury," Grijalva said, he wanted to reiterate that Rodriguez was required to keep his supervisors informed of absences or additional restrictions ordered by his physicians.45 He noted that Rodriguez had missed his last appointment [*8]  at U.S. Healthworks, and wished Rodriguez a swift recovery.46
Rodriguez asserts that on Feburary 10, 2012, he sent Grijalva a letter asking for W-2 forms, and asked that they be sent "to [his] new address listed on the top right side of [the letter]."47 The address was a location in Chula Vista, California.
Sugar Foods contends that Rodriguez did not contact his supervisors as directed in Grijalva's February 6, 2012 letter. Rodriguez, however, contends that one of his supervisors, David Ayala, told him to speak with human resources (i.e., Grijalva) about his return to work. This is corroborated by Ayala's deposition testimony. When asked whom Rodriguez should have called to determine when and if he should return to work, Ayala said: "That would probably be handled by Ronald [Grijalva] in HR, because he has a copy of this, also, and, yes, one of the supervisors, Jerry or myself[,] . . . [w]ould have to call Mr. Rodriguez."48 Rodriguez also contends he was trying to speak to Grijalva "on a daily basis, maybe every day."49 He asserts Grijalva gave him the run-around, and often avoided him:
"I left him messages when he wouldn't speak with me because I could hear him in the room, but according [*9]  to his assistant, he wouldn't be in the room. I would leave messages, messages, messages, and when he'll get back to me, he'll tell me what's going on, did I get ahold of my supervisors, and then I'll tell him that they told me to talk to him. It was a circle, you know. It was just a circle going back and forth, back and forth."50 
On the occasions Rodriguez was able to speak with Grijalva, he asserts, Grijalva did "not [ ] once . . . mention coming back with restrictions."51 Instead, Rodriguez maintains, Grijalva "basically said, You coming back? When are you ready to come back and jump on the forklift? And like basically saying, I ain't getting no light duty."52 During one such conversation, Rodriguez contends he asked for an accommodation in the form of additional recovery time: "I told him, Look, until I feel much better, I'm not going to come back to work. But let me - you know, let me feel a little bit better, you know? You guys want me to jump right from bed to go to work. Let me feel a little bit better."53
On February 29, 2012, because it had allegedly received no update from Rodriguez regarding his work status and he had not returned to work, Sugar Foods terminated Rodriguez [*10]  for "no call/no-show and job abandonment."54 Grijalva purportedly advised Rodriguez of his termination in a letter dated March 7, 2012, which was sent to the address in San Diego County Rodriguez provided in earlier correspondence.55 Grijalva also had a telephone conversation with Rodriguez the same day in which he advised Rodriguez of his termination.56 In his declaration, Grijalva contends he made the decision to terminate Rodriguez; when asked at his deposition, however, Luis Avila - one of Rodriguez's supervisors - asserted that he and Grijalva "agreed" to terminate Rodriguez.57 The parties dispute the motivation behind Rodriguez's termination. Sugar Foods contends the decision was not motivated by Rodriguez's medical condition, the fact that he had reported a work-related injury, or the fact that he had filed a worker's compensation claim. Rodriguez contends it was.58
In May 2012, Rodriguez submitted an application for disability benefits to the Social Security Administration ("SSA").59 At a worker's compensation hearing, he said he applied for disability benefits because he was "[n]ot . . . able to work" "[d]ue to [his] injury" at Sugar Foods.60 Rodriguez was ultimately awarded monthly [*11]  disability benefits of $1,000 from the SSA.61 Since his discharge on February 29, 2012, Rodriguez has not been employed.62 He admits his only attempt to locate new employment was completion of an online survey that "turned into" a job application for Target; he contends he did not pursue the opportunity because he did not believe anyone would hire him due to his condition.63 At no time has Rodriguez filed a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing regarding his employment at Sugar Foods.64 He contends that, as a result of his termination, he has suffered emotional distress, including sleeplessness, crying, anxiety, and panic attacks.65

II. DISCUSSION

A. Standard Governing Motions for Summary Judgment
A motion for summary judgment must be granted when "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 56. A party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for its motion and of identifying those portions of the pleadings and discovery responses that demonstrate the absence [*12]  of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Where the moving party will have the burden of proof on an issue at trial, the movant must affirmatively demonstrate that no reasonable trier of fact could find other than for the moving party. On an issue as to which the nonmoving party will have the burden of proof, however, the movant can prevail merely by pointing out that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. See id. If the moving party meets its initial burden, the nonmoving party must set forth, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Rule 56, "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); FED.R.CIV.PROC. 56(e)(2). Evidence presented by the parties at the summary judgment stage must be admissible. FED.R.CIV.PROC. 56(e)(1). In reviewing the record, the court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence. Rather, it draws all inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See T.W. Electric Service, Inc. v. Pacific Electric Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987).

B. Whether Sugar Foods is Entitled to Summary Judgment on Rodriguez's First, Third, Fifth, and Seventh Causes of Action for Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies
Sugar Foods contends it is entitled to summary judgment on Rodriguez's first, third, fifth, and seventh causes [*13]  of action because each of the claims arises under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), California Government Code § 12900, et seq, and Rodriguez failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under FEHA.66 See Rodriguez v. Airborne Express, 265 F.3d 890, 896 (9th Cir. 2001) ("In order to bring a civil action under FEHA, the aggrieved person must exhaust the administrative remedies provided by law. Exhaustion in this context requires filing a written charge with DFEH within one year of the alleged unlawful employment discrimination, and obtaining notice from DFEH of the right to sue," citing Romano v. Rockwell Int'l, Inc., 14 Cal.4th 479, 492, 59 Cal. Rptr. 2d 20, 926 P.2d 1114 (1996); Yurick v. Superior Court, 209 Cal.App.3d 1116, 1121, 257 Cal. Rptr. 665 (1989)). Rodriguez contends he does not assert FEHA claims, but rather invokes violations of FEHA as the predicate "public policy" that underlies his claims under Tameny v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 27 Cal.3d 167, 164 Cal. Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330 (1980).
In Tameny, the California Supreme Court held "that when an employer's discharge of an employee violates fundamental principles of public policy, the discharged employee may maintain a tort action." Id. at 170. In that case, plaintiff alleged that his employer terminated him because he refused to participate in an illegal scheme to fix gasoline prices. Id. at 169. The trial court sustained defendant's demurrer to plaintiff's wrongful discharge claim. Id. at 171. The California Supreme Court reversed, noting the long-standing rule "that a wrongful act committed in the [*14]  course of a contractual relationship may afford both tort and contractual relief." Id. at 174-175. The Court also observed that "an employer's obligation to refrain from discharging an employee who refuses to commit a criminal act . . . reflects a duty imposed by law upon all employers in order to implement the fundamental public policies embodied in the state's penal statutes." It thus held that the "wrongful discharge suit exhibit[ed] the classic elements of a tort cause of action." Id. at 176.
Rodriguez's first claim is captioned "Medical Condition/Medical Disability Discrimination in Violation of Public Policy."67 In City of Moorpark v. Superior Court, 18 Cal.4th 1143, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 445, 959 P.2d 752 (1998), the California Supreme Court held that the public policy against disability discrimination embodied in FEHA is "substantial and fundamental," and hence that "disability discrimination can form the basis of a common law wrongful discharge claim." Id. at 1160-61. Under City of Moorpark, therefore, Rodriguez can assert a Tameny claim based on Sugar Foods' purported disability discrimination in violation of FEHA. He can do this whether or not he exhausted his remedies under FEHA. See Rojo v. Kliger, 52 Cal.3d 65, 88, 276 Cal. Rptr. 130, 801 P.2d 373 (1990) ("We conclude, therefore, that although an employee must exhaust the FEHA administrative remedy before bringing suit on a cause of action under the [*15]  act or seeking the relief provided therein, exhaustion is not required before filing a civil action for damages alleging nonstatutory causes of action"); Leibert v. Transworld Sys., Inc., 32 Cal.App.4th 1693, 1705, 39 Cal. Rptr. 2d 65 (1995) (same).
Rodriguez's third claim is captioned "Discrimination Based on Participation in Protected Conduct."68 He maintains that Sugar Foods' decision to terminate him was based on his filing of a worker's compensation claim; he asserts this was "protected conduct" under the public policy set forth in FEHA.69 Thus, as with the first cause of action, it would appear that Rodriguez's third claim asserts a Tameny claim.
Sugar Foods disputes this characterization of the claims, arguing that Rodriguez acknowledged during settlement discussions that the claims were, in fact, FEHA claims. The email Sugar Foods cites, from Rodriguez's counsel to Sugar Foods' lawyer, states: "Please ensure that you ha[ve] informed your client, in writing, of our now withdrawn offer to dismiss the FEHA claims."70 This isolated statement is not dispositive, however, given the manner in which the claims are pled - which governs the court's consideration of them - and because Rodriguez's lawyer may have intended to suggest that the causes of action were Tameny claims based on FEHA. [*16] 
Like the second cause of action, the first and third are based on two public policies: FEHA discrimination and FEHA retaliation. The second cause of action is based on both policies, and Sugar Foods does not dispute that that cause of action pleads a Tameny claim. The court thus addresses these public policies to determine whether there are triable issues as to whether they were violated.
Rodriguez's fifth and seventh causes of action are of a different character. The fifth claim is captioned one for "Refusal to Accommodate Disability/Medical Condition," while the seventh is captioned a claim for "Failure to Participate in Timely and Good Faith Interactive Process."71 Unlike the first and third causes of action, which plead that they are based on the violation of public policies set forth in FEHA, these claims make no mention of public policy; instead, the allegations all address of the elements of a FEHA claim. See Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940(m) ("It is an unlawful employment practice . . . [f]or an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee"); id., § 12940(n) (""It is an unlawful employment practice . . . [f]or an [*17]  employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition").
Stated differently, the complaint lacks any allegations suggesting that the fifth and seventh causes of action are Tameny claims; Sugar Foods was therefore not on notice that Rodriguez was asserting Tamney claims premised on refusal to accommodate his disability or to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process. Rodriguez does not offer any reasoned argument suggesting otherwise.
Although he asserts that the first and third causes of action contain allegations suggesting they are Tameny claims, he does not make a similar argument regarding the fifth and seventh claims.72 In addition, Rodriguez includes a prayer for "attorney's fees as allowed by statute"; this would reasonably have conveyed to Sugar Foods that the fifth and seventh claims, which did not plead that they were based on the common law/public policy articulated in the relevant FEHA [*18]  sections, that they were statutory FEHA claims, not Tameny claims.73 Ninth Circuit "precedents make clear that where, as here, the complaint does not include the necessary factual allegations to state a claim, raising such claim in a summary judgment motion is insufficient to present the claim to the district court." See Navajo Nation v. U.S. Forest Serv., 535 F.3d 1058, 1080 (9th Cir. 2008) (citing Wasco Prods., Inc. v. Southwall Techs., Inc., 435 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir. 2006) ("'Simply put, summary judgment is not a procedural second chance to flesh out inadequate pleadings'")); Pickern v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.), Inc., 457 F.3d 963, 968-69 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding that a complaint did not satisfy the notice pleading requirements of Rule 8(a) because it "gave the [defendants] no notice of the specific factual allegations presented for the first time in [plaintiff's] opposition to summary judgment"). Thus, even to the extent Rodriguez contends he intended to assert Tameny claims in his fifth and seventh causes of action, he failed to allege facts sufficient to state Tameny claims, and cannot raise them for the first time in opposition to Sugar Foods' summary judgment motion.
It is undisputed that Rodriguez did not file a claim with the DFEH.74 Because he did not exhaust administrative remedies, the court grants summary judgment in favor of Sugar Foods on Rodriguez's fifth and seventh causes of action alleging refusal to accommodate his [*19]  disability and failure to engage in a good faith, interactive process in violation of FEHA. See Rodriguez, 265 F.3d at 898 (affirming summary judgment for the defendant employer because "Rodriguez failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his claim for disability discrimination"); Burton v. New United Motor Mfg., 127 Fed. Appx. 283, 285 (9th Cir. Apr. 1, 2005) (Unpub. Disp.) (affirming summary judgment in favor of defendant "because [the employee] failed to exhaust her administrative remedies under FEHA"); Watson v. Chubb & Sons, Inc., 32 Fed. Appx. 827, 828 (9th Cir. Feb. 13, 2002) (Unpub. Disp.) (same); Okoli v. Lockheed Technical Operations Co., 36 Cal.App.4th 1607, 1617, 43 Cal. Rptr. 2d 57 (1995) (claims not raised or "reasonably related" to those raised in a DFEH claim are "barred by the exhaustion of remedies doctrine").
Because the first and third causes of action explicitly allege violation of public policies embodied in FEHA, Sugar Foods was on notice, or reasonably should have been on notice, that they were Tameny claims.75 Sugar Foods asserts that even if this is true, the claims fail because Rodriguez cannot raise triable issues of fact concerning discrimination or retaliation based on protected conduct, and because his restrictions were fully accommodated.76 The court therefore addresses these claims, as well as Rodriguez's second, fourth, and sixth claims, on the [*20]  merits.

C. Rodriguez's Claims for Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
As noted, California law recognizes a claim for wrongful termination in violation of a public policy reflected in a statute or constitutional provision. Tameny, 27 Cal.3d at 172 ("In a series of cases arising out of a variety of factual settings in which a discharge clearly violated an express statutory objective or undermined a firmly established principle of public policy, courts have recognized that an employer's traditional broad authority to discharge an at-will employee 'may be limited by statute . . . or by considerations of public policy'" (citations omitted)); see also Kelly v. Methodist Hospital of Southern California, 22 Cal.4th 1108, 1112, 95 Cal. Rptr. 2d 514, 997 P.2d 1169 (2000) ("Tameny claims permit wrongful termination damages when a termination is undertaken in violation of a fundamental, substantial and well-established public policy of state law grounded in a statute or constitutional provision"); Gantt v. Sentry Insurance, 1 Cal.4th 1083, 1094-95, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 874, 824 P.2d 680 (1992) (same), disapproved on other grounds in Green v. Ralee Engineering Co., 19 Cal.4th 66, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046 (1998).
"Tameny claims supplement FEHA claims alleging an improper termination due to race, age, disability, or retaliation, and may be asserted in conjunction with such claims." Pace v. Century Gaming Management, Inc., No. B200070, 2009 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2062, 2009 WL 662086, *16 (Cal. App. Mar. 16, 2009) (Unpub. Disp.) (citing, inter alia, Ross v. San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Dist. 146 Cal.App.4th 1507, 1515, 53 Cal. Rptr. 3d 715 (2007) (recognizing a Tameny claim premised on wrongful termination based on disability discrimination)). [*21] 77 For "a policy to support a wrongful discharge claim, it must be: (1) delineated in either constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) 'public' in the sense that it 'inures to the benefit of the public' rather than serving merely the interests of the individual; (3) well established at the time of the discharge; and (4) substantial and fundamental." See Stevenson v. Superior Court, 16 Cal.4th 880, 894, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 888, 941 P.2d 1157 (1997). As noted, discrimination and retaliation in violation of FEHA supports a Tameny claim. See City of Moorpark, 18 Cal.4th at 1160-61; see also DeHorney v. Bank of Am. Nat. Trust & Sav. Ass'n, 879 F.2d 459, 465 (9th Cir. 1989) ("Discharges which have been found to offend public policy include discharge for refusal to commit perjury; discharge for union membership and activity; discharge for serving on a jury; discharge for filing a worker's compensation claim; and discharge for reporting violations of consumer protection laws."). Because Rodriguez's Tameny claims are premised on FEHA, the court sets forth the legal standard governing FEHA claims below.

1. Whether Rodriguez Raises Triable Issues Concerning His Tameny Claims for Disability Discrimination and Retaliation in Violation of the Public Policy Espoused in FEHA
"When a plaintiff alleges [discriminatory or] retaliatory employment termination either as a claim under the FEHA or as a claim for wrongful employment [*22]  termination in violation of public policy, and the defendant seeks summary judgment, California follows the burden shifting analysis of [McDonnell Douglas] to determine whether there are triable issues of fact for resolution by a jury." See Loggins v. Kaiser Permanente Int'l, 151 Cal.App.4th 1102, 1108-09, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 45 (2007); see also Vargas v. BP Am. Inc., 549 Fed. Appx. 641, 642 (9th Cir. Dec. 11, 2013) (Unpub. Disp.) (applying the McDonnell Douglas framework to a Tameny claim); Martinez v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 438 Fed. Appx. 595, 596 (9th Cir. June 16, 2011) (Unpub. Disp.) (citing Loggins in affirming the district court's dismissal of a state law wrongful termination claim based on gender discrimination); Middlekauff v. Hearst Corp., No. 12-CV-00105 KJM, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49886, 2014 WL 1389760, *4 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 9, 2014) ("Courts apply the burden-shifting framework from [McDonnell Douglas], to a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy").
Sugar Foods disputes that Rodriguez can prove the elements of FEHA discrimination and retaliation claims. A plaintiff's failure to make a prima facie showing of discrimination or retaliation under FEHA "disposes of [wrongful termination] claim[s] as well." See DeHorney, 879 F.2d at 465 (9th Cir. 1989) ("DeHorney claims that she was discharged because of Bank of America's racial animus against her and that such action violates basic public policy. As discussed . . ., however, DeHorney's failure to make a prima facie case of racial discrimination disposes of this claim as well. Accordingly, [*23]  we affirm the district court's decision rejecting her claim against Bank of America for termination in violation of public policy"). The court thus evaluates whether Sugar Foods is correct that Rodriguez cannot establish the predicate FEHA violations that support his wrongful termination claims.

a. Legal Standard Governing FEHA Claims
FEHA prohibits employers from discriminating and/or retaliating against employees on certain enumerated grounds, including physical disability and protected conduct. Cal.Gov't Code § 12940(a), (h). The statute defines "physical disability" as "any physiological disease, disorder, condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss that . . . affects one or more of the following body systems: neurological, immunological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory, including speech organs, cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin, and endocrine [and that] . . . limits a major life activity. . . ."78 Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(k)(1); see generally Cassista v. Community Foods, Inc., 5 Cal.4th 1050, 1143-61 (1993) (providing a detailed overview of the law of "physical handicap"/"physical disability" discrimination in California), superseded by statute as recognized in Bagatti v. Department of Rehabilitation, 97 Cal.App.4th 344, 118 Cal. Rptr. 2d 443 (2002).
Section 12940(h) declares that it is an unlawful employment practice for "any employer . . . or person to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed [*25]  any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." CAL. GOV'T. CODE § 12940(h). "This enactment aids enforcement of the FEHA and promotes communication and informal dispute resolution in the workplace." Miller v. Dep't of Corr., 36 Cal.4th 446, 472, 30 Cal. Rptr. 3d 797, 115 P.3d 77 (2005) (citing Flait v. North American Watch Corp., 3 Cal.App.4th 467, 476-77, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 522 (1992)).
In evaluating FEHA discrimination and retaliation claims, California looks to federal precedent governing analogous federal discrimination laws. See Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc., 24 Cal.4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000) ("Because of the similarity between state and federal employment discrimination laws, California courts look to pertinent federal precedent when applying our own statutes. . . . In particular, California has adopted the three-stage burden-shifting test established by the United States Supreme Court for trying claims of discrimination . . . based on a theory of disparate treatment" (citations omitted)); Flait, 3 Cal.App.4th at 475-76 ("CFEHA prohibits an employer from terminating any employee, including at-will employees, for attempting to comply with its provisions forbidding racial, sexual or other forms of job harassment. Lawsuits claiming retaliatory employment termination in violation of CFEHA are analogous to federal Title VII claims, and are evaluated under federal law interpreting Title [*26]  VII cases").79
Thus, a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of discrimination either by adducing direct evidence of discriminatory intent, or by satisfying his burden under McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973).80 See Vasquez v. County of Los Angeles, 349 F.3d 634, 640 (9th Cir. 2004) ("For a prima facie case, Vasquez must offer evidence that 'give[s] rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination,' either through the framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green or with direct or circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent"); cf. Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 354 ("This so-called McDonnell Douglas test reflects the principle that direct evidence of intentional discrimination is rare, and that such claims must usually be proved circumstantially").81 The McDonnell Douglas framework also applies to retaliation claims. See Xin Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125, 1143 (9th Cir. 2003) ("For purposes of summary judgment, we analyze Liu's Title VII and FEHA retaliation claim under the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting standard").
In McDonnell Douglas Corp., the Supreme Court held that plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination. If plaintiff succeeds in proving a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action. Should defendant carry this burden of production, the burden of proof shifts [*27]  back to plaintiff to demonstrate that a material question of fact exists concerning as to whether defendant's asserted reason is the true reason or a mere pretext. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802, 804. See also St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993); Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-253 (1981).
Thus, a plaintiff seeking to defeat summary judgment must establish a prima facie case and, once defendant has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions, raise triable issues of fact as to whether the articulated reason is pretextual. Sischo-Nownejad v. Merced Community College District, 934 F.2d 1104, 1110 (9th Cir. 1991), superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized in Dominguez-Curry v. Nevada Transp. Dept., 424 F.3d 1027 (9th Cir. 2005); see also Nidds v. Schindler Elevator Corp., 113 F.3d 912, 917-18 (9th Cir. 1997) ("To . . . survive summary judgment, [plaintiff] must produce enough evidence to allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude either: (a) that the alleged reason for [plaintiff's] discharge was false, or (b) that the true reason for his discharge was a discriminatory one"). "Very little" evidence need be adduced to make out a prima facie case. Sischo-Nownejad, 934 F.2d at 1111 (quoting Lowe v. City of Monrovia, 775 F.2d 998, 1009 (9th Cir.1985), as amended, 784 F.2d 1407 (1986)).
McDonnell Douglas, a refusal to hire case, held that a plaintiff could establish a prima facie case "by showing (i) that he belong[ed] to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, [*28]  the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant's qualifications." McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. The Court cautioned against rigid application of this test, however, noting that "facts necessarily will vary in [discrimination] cases, and [that its] specification . . . of the prima facie proof required from [plaintiff] [would] not necessarily [be] applicable in every respect to differing factual situations." Id. at 802 n. 13.
Courts evaluating discriminatory discharge claims have thus made various adjustments to the McDonnell Douglas formulation. In Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, 150 F.3d 1217 (9th Cir. 1998), for example, the Ninth Circuit held that a plaintiff had established a prima facie case of sex discrimination under FEHA by establishing that "(1) she belong[ed] to a protected class, (2) she [had been] performing according to her employer's legitimate expectations, (3) she [had] suffered an adverse employment action, and (4) other employees with qualifications similar to her own were treated more favorably." Id. at 1220.
The California Supreme Court synthesized these formulations into a generalized test in Guz, 24 Cal.4th 317. It held that "the plaintiff must provide evidence that (1) he was a member of a protected class, (2) he was qualified for the position he sought or was [*29]  performing competently in the position he held, (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available job, and (4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive." Id. at 355 (citations omitted).
Similarly, to state a "prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she was engaging in a protected activity, (2) the employer subjected her to an adverse employment decision, and (3) there was a causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action." See Xin Liu, 347 F.3d at1143-44; Flait, 3 Cal.App.4th at 476 ("the plaintiff must show that he engaged in a protected activity, his employer subjected him to adverse employment action, and there is a causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action").
Sugar Foods contends first that Rodriguez's claims are time-barred. It also argues, with respect to his discrimination claim, that he is not a qualified individual, he cannot show causation, and that even if he could establish these elements, it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory, non-pretextual reason for terminating him.
Sugar Foods does not dispute that filing a worker's compensation claim is protected conduct for purposes of a retaliation claim. [*30] 82 It contends only that Rodriguez cannot prove causation, and that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory, non-pretextual reason for terminating him. Because the statute of limitations, causation, and pretext questions overlap, the court addresses them together.

b. Whether Rodriguez's Wrongful Termination Claims Are Time-Barred
Sugar Foods argues that that summary judgment must be entered in its favor because Rodriguez's wrongful termination claims are time-barred.83 "The statute of limitations applicable to a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy is two years." See Van De Streek v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., No. CV 13-02282 MMC, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71270, 2014 WL 2186802, *5 (N.D. Cal. May 23, 2014) (citing Mathieu v. Norrell Corp., 115 Cal.App. 4th 1174, 1189 n. 14, 10 Cal. Rptr. 3d 52 (2004) (noting that "[e]ffective January 1, 2003, the statute of limitations was changed [from one] to two years," in turn citing CAL. CODE CIV. PROC. § 335.1); Sarkizi v. Graham Packaging Co., No. CV 13-1435 AWI SKO, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76275, 2014 WL 2506600, *7 (E.D. Cal. June 3, 2014) ("A Tameny claim is a common law cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy which has a two-year statute of limitations, regardless of its statutory basis"). Rodriguez asserts he did not learn he had been terminated until the telephone call he had with Grijalva on March 7, 2012, and that he filed his complaint within two years of that date.84
Under California's discovery rule, a cause of action does not accrue until the plaintiff discovers, [*31]  or has reason to discover, that he has been wronged. See Jolly v. Eli Lilly & Co., 44 Cal.3d 1103, 1110-11, 245 Cal. Rptr. 658, 751 P.2d 923 (1988). "[T]he plaintiff discovers the cause of action when he at least suspects a factual basis, as opposed to a legal theory, for its elements, even if he lacks knowledge thereof - when, simply put, he at least 'suspects . . . that someone has done something wrong' to him, 'wrong' being used, not in any technical sense, but rather in accordance with its 'lay understanding.'" Norgart v. Upjohn Co., 21 Cal.4th 383, 397-98, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 453, 981 P.2d 79 (1999) (quoting Jolly, 44 Cal.3d at 1110 & n. 7). The plaintiff has reason to discover the wrong when he has "notice or information of circumstances [sufficient] to put a reasonable person on inquiry." Jolly, 44 Cal.3d at 1110-11 (quoting Gutierrez v. Mofid, 39 Cal.3d 892, 896-97, 218 Cal. Rptr. 313, 705 P.2d 886 (1985)). In order for the discovery rule to delay accrual of a cause of action, the plaintiff must show that he "conduct[ed] a reasonable investigation of all potential causes of [his] injury," and failed to discover that the injury was wrongfully caused "despite reasonable diligence." Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., 35 Cal.4th 797, 808, 27 Cal. Rptr. 3d 661, 110 P.3d 914 (2005) (quoting McKelvey v. Boeing N. American, Inc., 74 Cal.App.4th 151, 160, 86 Cal. Rptr. 2d 645 (1999)).
The California Court of Appeal's decision in Barton v. New United Motor Mfg., Inc., 43 Cal.App.4th 1200, 51 Cal. Rptr. 2d 328 (1996) is instructive here. There, plaintiff alleged that he had been terminated in retaliation for reporting unsafe working conditions. He filed his complaint more than a year after his termination, and the trial court sustained the employer's demurrer without [*32]  leave to amend, concluding that the claim was time-barred by the then-operative one-year statute of limitation. Id. at 1204. Plaintiff argued on appeal that the trial court should have granted leave to amend "to determine whether he was entitled to the benefit of the delayed discovery rule." Id. at 1209. He argued he was entitled to invoke the delayed discovery rule because it was not until two years after his discharge that "he fully underst[ood] 'the dimensions' of his wrongful termination." Id. The appellate court was not persuaded. It stated: "Under some circumstances, the statute of limitations will not begin to run until the injured party discovers or should have discovered the facts supporting liability. Nevertheless, the infliction of actual and appreciable harm will commence the statutory period, even if there is uncertainty as to the amount of damages. From plaintiff's own complaint and amended complaint, it is apparent that he suffered actual and appreciable harm when he was terminated in October 1992, and the delayed discovery rule is of no assistance to him." Id. at 1209-10.
Rodriguez contends he did not learn that he had been terminated until March 7, 2012. Sugar Foods has adduced no evidence to the contrary. [*33]  It argues that the fact that it sent a termination letter on March 7, 2012, stating that Rodriguez had been terminated effective February 29, 2012, and the fact that Grijalva told Rodriguez during a telephone call on March 7, 2012 that he had been terminated effective February 29, 2012, is sufficient to bar his claims. Neither of these communications precedes the date on which Rodriguez states he learned of the termination, however. Crediting Rodriguez's argument that he did not know of the termination until March 7, 2012, he was unaware of "the infliction of actual and appreciable harm" until that time. Id. at 1209. Stated differently, he had no reason to suspect that he had been wronged and no reason to investigate the factual basis for the wrong, i.e., he lacked "notice or information of circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry" prior to that time. Jolly, 44 Cal.3d at 1110-11 (quoting Gutierrez, 39 Cal.3d at 896-97); see also Norgart, 21 Cal.4th at 397-98 ("plaintiff discovers the cause of action when he at least suspects a factual basis, as opposed to a legal theory, for its elements, even if he lacks knowledge thereof - when, simply put, he at least 'suspects . . . that someone has done something wrong' to him, 'wrong' being used, not in any technical sense, but [*34]  rather in accordance with its 'lay understanding,'" quoting Jolly, 44 Cal.3d at 1110 & n. 7).
Sugar Foods contends, however, that the fact that Rodriguez filed an application for unemployment benefits with the California Employment Development Department ("EDD") on February 12, 2012 shows his wrongful termination claims are time-barred. Rodriguez, however, did not state in the EDD application that he had been terminated. He stated only that he "got hurt at work and [was] under investigation from the workers comp, and [he didn't] feel well yet to return to work."85 Rodriguez argued at the hearing that he did not intend to indicate that he had been fired, and the language he used on the form appears to corroborate that fact. Sugar Foods may intend to argue that by completing an unemployment form, Rodriguez engaged in conduct that amounted to a constructive discharge. "Constructive discharge occurs when the employer's conduct effectively forces an employee to resign. . . . [T]he employment relationship is . . . severed involuntarily by the employer's acts, against the employee's will." Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 7 Cal.4th 1238, 1244-45, 32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022 (1994). The Turner Court noted that "[a]ctual discharge carries significant legal consequences for employers, including possible liability [*35]  for wrongful discharge. [Thus, i]n an attempt to avoid liability, an employer may refrain from actually firing an employee, preferring instead to engage in conduct causing him or her to quit. The doctrine of constructive discharge addresses such employer-attempted 'end runs' around wrongful discharge and other claims requiring employer-initiated terminations of employment." Id. at 1244.
Constructive discharge "occurs only when the employer coerces the employee's resignation, either by creating working conditions that are intolerable under an objective standard, or by failing to remedy objectively intolerable working conditions that actually are known to the employer." Mullins v. Rockwell Internat. Corp., 15 Cal.4th 731, 737, 63 Cal. Rptr. 2d 636, 936 P.2d 1246 (1997). The statute of limitations on constructive discharge claims is tied to the employee's actual discharge. In Mullins, the California Supreme Court addressed whether a breach of contract claim based on a constructive discharge accrued on the date of the alleged constructive discharge or the date of actual termination. In doing so, the Court discussed Regents of University of California v. Superior Court, 33 Cal.App.4th 1710, 39 Cal. Rptr. 2d 919 (1995). There, the Court of Appeal rejected the constructive discharge claim of a medical resident who alleged sex discrimination and sexual harassment. The resident contended that the chair of surgery [*36]  had sexually harassed her, and then told her she would have to repeat her third year of residency because of poor performance. Id. at 1713-14. The resident spent a year working in the laboratory, and ultimately left the program rather than repeat the year, and instead filed suit against the university. Id. at 1714. The Mullins Court observed that the Regents court had concluded that the date the resident was notified of the adverse employment decision - not the date of her actual termination - was the date the statute of limitations began to run, and held that the resident could not avoid the limitations bar by alleging a constructive discharge." Mullins, 15 Cal.4th at 739-40 (citing Regents, 33 Cal.App.4th at 1713, 1723). The Regents court also "stated that the date of actual termination should not be the date the statute of limitations begins to run for a constructive discharge claim, because such a date would be arbitrary and would vest complete control over the limitations period in the employee." Id. (citing Regents, 33 Cal.App.4th at 1722). In both Mullins, 15 Cal.4th at 740 n. 1, and Romano v. Rockwell Internat., Inc., 14 Cal.4th 479, 502, 59 Cal. Rptr. 2d 20, 926 P.2d 1114 (1996), the California Supreme Court disapproved of this holding.
Noting Rockwell's "concern [that] . . . employees [not be vested] with sole control over the commencement of the statute of limitations period, which it assert[ed] would leave employers unaware of the accrual of a cause [*37]  of action until an employee resigns," - a concern similar to that expressed by the Regents court - the Mullins Court observed that
"[t]he essence of constructive discharge is that it is a termination of employment secured by the employer through indirect means. The employer remains in control in that he or she coerces the employee's resignation. Just as an employer who gives advance notice of impending termination of employment has knowledge sufficient to prepare for a possible lawsuit, an employer who creates or knows of intolerable conditions is in the same position to be prepared for a possible lawsuit when the coerced resignation finally occurs. In addition, the alleged intolerable condition - a circumstance in the control of the employer - normally continues up until the time of resignation, so that the litigation will not relate to some long-ago event, but to recent circumstances. Nor is it true that having the statute of limitations run from the date of termination leaves the employee able to delay the bringing of a lawsuit indefinitely." Id. at 740.
Ultimately, the court concluded that "[b]ecause (1) constructive discharge is an employer-directed termination of employment, (2) termination normally is [*38]  the breach alleged, and (3) the employee may elect to overlook earlier adverse actions of the employer in the hope of conciliation, we conclude that the statute of limitations does not begin to run until actual termination." Id. at 743.
Although Mullins was a breach of contract action, California Courts of Appeal have applied its reasoning to tort causes of action, such as wrongful termination:
"The Mullins court held that in breach of contract actions alleging constructive wrongful termination of employment, it is the actual termination of employment that starts the statute of limitations period running, not when the alleged intolerable working conditions occur. Similarly, in Romano, the court held that in wrongful termination cases, whether the plaintiff alleges contract or tort causes of action, or violations of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act, the statute of limitations begins to run on the date the employment is actually terminated, not the date on which an employee is unequivocally informed his employment will be terminated. When we combine these holdings with Code of Civil Procedure section 312's directive that statutes of limitation begin to run 'after the cause of action shall have accrued,' we conclude that for purposes of filing [*39]  a tort claim for wrongful termination, the cause of action accrues when the employment is actually terminated." Colores v. Bd. of Trustees, 105 Cal.App.4th 1293, 1320, 130 Cal. Rptr. 2d 347 (2003).
Thus, to the extent Rodriguez's filing of a claim for unemployment benefits can be viewed as a statement that he had been constructively discharged - which, as noted, is questionable - the statute of limitations began to run on the date on which Rodriguez was actually terminated, not the date on which the allegedly intolerable conditions leading to the discharge began. Rodriguez is also, as noted, entitled to have the statute of limitations tolled from the date of the actual termination to the date he was first advised of it. For that reason, even if the court construed his EDD application for unemployment insurance benefits as constructive termination, his wrongful termination claims would not be time barred. Accordingly, the court denies Sugar Foods' motion for summary judgment on Rodriguez's wrongful termination claims to the extent it is based on an argument that the claims are time-barred.

c. Whether Rodriguez Was a Qualified Individual for Purposes of a FEHA Disability Discrimination Claim
Sugar Foods next argues that Rodriguez was not a qualified individual, purportedly [*40]  because he admitted he has not sought employment since his termination because he cannot work.86 See Brickers v. Cleveland Bd. of Educ., 145 F.3d 846, 849 (6th Cir. 1998) ("The . . . issue to resolve is whether she is 'otherwise qualified,' i.e., whether she can perform the essential functions of the job"); see also Foster v. City of Oakland, 649 F.Supp.2d 1008, 1018 (N.D. Cal. 2009) ("Under. . . FEHA, a qualified individual is one with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the job the individual holds," citing Kennedy v. Applause, Inc., 90 F.3d 1477, 1481 (9th Cir. 1996)); Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal.App.4th 245, 255 n. 3, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000) ("The term 'qualified individual' comes from the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. . . .) which defines 'qualified individual with a disability' as 'an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires'"); Brundage v. Hahn, 57 Cal.App.4th 228, 235, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 830 (1997) (stating that a "qualified individual with a disability" under FEHA is "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires" (citation omitted)).

(1) Alleged Admissions in Deposition Testimony
Sugar Foods argues that Rodriguez admitted at his deposition that he could not work, and thus acknowledged that he is not a qualified [*41]  individual.87 The evidence it cites, however, is not an admission by Rodriguez that he cannot work. Asked why he had not found work, Rodriguez stated:
"For me to get a job, I'm not going to start a job with restrictions. It's not going to happen like that. I need to find a job and be able to work. Nobody is going to hire somebody that can't do nothing."88
This statement does not unequivocally concede that Rodriguez cannot perform any work, with or without restrictions. Although a jury might interpret it that way, the statement is just as easily (and more properly) understood as an assertion that Rodriguez did not believe a new employer would hire him based on the restrictions doctors had placed on his work. Other statements by Rodriguez during the deposition corroborate this understanding of the statement.89
Sugar Foods' lawyer asked whether Rodriguez believed he could not "do anything" work-related. He replied that he would have returned to Sugar Foods to do restricted light duty work: "If I would return to Sugar Foods let's say, uh, restricted light duty, if they were - if they were to offer it, I'm just saying."90 Rodriguez also testified, however, that he felt he could not work: "Q. [*42]  Okay. So basically [David] said they were going to accommodate your restrictions that you were given by U.S. HealthWorks?
A. Yes. They told me they were going to do that.
Q. Okay. And do you remember anything else about that conversation?
A. I remember telling him that I couldn't do that, that I was even on the bed as we were speaking."91
As noted, however, Rodriguez's inability to work at that time was confirmed when he returned to U.S. Healthworks on January 23, 2012, and saw Dr. Jesus Mendoza; during that visit, he was given two additional days off work and advised to return to U.S. Healthworks on January 25, 2012.92 A reasonable jury could construe Rodriguez's statement to Grijalva as conveying that he was unable to work at that time - days after his injury - not that he would be unable to work in the future or ever again. Consequently, Rodriguez's deposition testimony does not demonstrate the absence of triable issues of fact as to whether he is a qualified individual.

(2) Alleged Admissions in the SSA Proceedings
Sugar Foods also argues that because Rodriguez applied for and received disability benefits from the SSA, he must have told the agency that he was unable to work. It asserts [*43]  he "should not now be permitted to take an inconsistent position."93 Although not denominated as such, Sugar Foods appears to argue that Rodriguez should be judicially estopped from denying he cannot work.
Judicial estoppel "'generally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase.'" New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749, 121 S. Ct. 1808, 149 L. Ed. 2d 968 (2001) (citations omitted). Judicial estoppel is not limited to different phases of a single case, however. It applies to positions taken in prior judicial or administrative proceedings as well. See Milton H. Greene Archives, Inc. v. Marilyn Monroe LLC, 692 F.3d 983, 993 (9th Cir. 2012) ("A party can be estopped by statements successfully advanced in both judicial and administrative proceedings"); Rissetto v. Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 343, 94 F.3d 597, 604 (9th Cir. 1996) ("[M]any cases have applied the doctrine where the prior statement was made in an administrative proceeding, and we are not aware of any case refusing to apply the doctrine because the prior proceeding was administrative rather than judicial"); Chaveriat v. Williams Pipe Line Co., 11 F.3d 1420, 1427 (7th Cir. 1993) ("Though called judicial estoppel, the doctrine has been applied, rightly in our view, to proceedings in which a party to an administrative proceeding obtains a favorable order that he seeks to repudiate in a subsequent judicial proceeding," collecting cases); Smith v. Montgomery Ward & Co., 388 F.2d 291, 292 (6th Cir. 1968) (position [*44]  taken in a workers' compensation proceeding estopped a party in a subsequent personal injury action).
"[F]ederal law governs the application of judicial estoppel in federal court." Rissetto v. Plumbers and Steamfitters Loca 343, 94 F.3d 597, 603 (9th Cir. 1996). The doctrine applies to positions taken in the same action or in different actions. See id. at 605 ("We now make it explicit that the doctrine of judicial estoppel is not confined to inconsistent positions taken in the same litigation"). It also "applies to a party's stated position whether it is an expression of intention, a statement of fact, or a legal assertion." Wagner v. Professional Engineers in California Government, 354 F.3d 1036, 1044 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing Helfand v. Gerson, 105 F.3d 530, 535 (9th Cir. 1997)).
Factors relevant in deciding whether to apply the doctrine include: (1) whether the party's later position is "clearly inconsistent" with his earlier position; (2) whether the party has successfully advanced the earlier position, such that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in the later proceeding would create a perception that either the first or the second court had been misled; and (3) "whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped." New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 751 (citations omitted).
In addition to these factors, the Ninth Circuit examines [*45]  "whether the party to be estopped acted inadvertently or with any degree of intent." EaglePicher Inc. v. Federal Ins. Co., CV 04-870 PHX MHM, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57683, 2007 WL 2265659, *3 (D. Ariz. Aug. 6, 2007) (citing Johnson v. Oregon Dep't of Human Resources Rehab. Div., 141 F.3d 1361, 1369 (9th Cir. 1998)); see also Prach v. Bowen Property Mgmt., CV 03-250 EFS, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7239, 2007 WL 397453, *4 (E.D. Wash. Feb. 1, 2007) ("Although Defendants cite authority that litigants should be bound by the actions of their attorneys, the inquiry is not whether Plaintiff Kriger is 'bound' by the mistakes in the original schedules, but rather whether the Plaintiff Kriger (along with his counsel) acted intentionally, as opposed to inadvertently"). "Judicial estoppel applies when a party's position is 'tantamount to a knowing misrepresentation to or even fraud on the court.'" Johnson, 141 F.3d at 1369 (quoting Ryan Operations G.P. v. Santiam-Midwest Lumber Co., 81 F.3d 355, 362-63 (3d Cir. 1996)). Thus, "[i]f incompatible positions are based not on chicanery, but only on inadvertence or mistake, judicial estoppel does not apply." Id. (citing In re Corey, 892 F.2d 829, 836 (9th Cir. 1989)); see also Wyler Summit Partnership v. Turner Broadcasting Sys., Inc., 235 F.3d 1184, 1190 (9th Cir. 2000) ("The doctrine of judicial estoppel requires, inter alia, a knowing antecedent misrepresentation by the person or party alleged to be estopped and prevents the party from tendering a contradictory assertion to a court," citing Russell v. Rolfs, 893 F.2d 1033, 1037 (9th Cir. 1990)). "Thus, if a claimant's particular representations are so inconsistent that they amount to an affront to the court, judicial estoppel may apply." Johnson, 141 F.3d at 1369.
A party may invoke the doctrine of judicial estoppel in a motion for summary judgment to bar a claim [*46]  based on an inconsistent position. See Elston v. Westport Ins. Co., 253 Fed. Appx. 697, 2007 WL 3268429, *2 (9th Cir., 2007) (Unpub. Disp.) (affirming the district court's grant of summary judgment against plaintiff on the basis that her claims were barred by judicial estoppel). A party seeking to defeat summary judgment on judicial estoppel grounds must "sufficiently explain" a prior judicial position that is inconsistent with an essential element of its current claim. See, e.g., Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 806, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999) (stating that a party must "provide a sufficient explanation" for a prior inconsistent position to defeat summary judgment); Fewer v. Copper & Brass Sales, Inc., 183 Fed. Appx. 696, 696 (9th Cir. June 9, 2006) (Unpub. Disp.) ("John J. Fewer appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Copper & Brass Sales and Thyssen, Inc. ('C & B') on Fewer's claims of failure to accommodate, disability and age discrimination in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ('FEHA') and his claim of wrongful termination in violation of public policy. . . . Because Fewer failed to 'proffer a sufficient explanation' to the district court for these inconsistent positions, the court did not abuse its discretion applying the doctrine of judicial estoppel," citing Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 806); Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Felipe Grimberg Fine Art, Civ 04-763 RLE, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10544, 2008 WL 394808, *4 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 13, 2008) ("To survive a motion for summary judgment, . . . an individual must explain why his or her [*47]  previous position or contention is consistent with his or her current position," citing Mitchell v. Washingtonville Central School District, 190 F.3d 1, 7 (2d Cir. 1999)); compare Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Moose Creek, Inc., 486 F.3d 629, 634 (9th Cir. 2007) (concluding that the evidence plaintiff presented distinguishing its position from the position it took in prior litigation "fail[ed] to rebut the determination of clear inconsistency," and thus "[t]he application of judicial estoppel . . . was not an abuse of discretion"); Committee of Russian Federation on Precious Metals and Gems v. United States, 987 F.Supp. 1181, 1185 (N.D. Cal. 1997) (denying summary judgment on judicial estoppel grounds in part because "this court neither finds that the IRS's position that the diamonds and valuables were fraudulently converted from the Committee has been adopted by the Tax Court at this time, nor that the IRS is 'playing fast and loose' with the judicial system").
The Supreme Court's decision in Cleveland, 526 U.S. 795, is instructive in assessing whether Sugar Foods' argument has merit. There, an employee sued a former employer for wrongful termination under the Americans with Disabilities Act after applying for Social Security disability insurance. Id. at 799. The district court entered summary judgment in favor of the employer instead of adjudicating the plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim on the merits because, in the court's view, "Cleveland, by applying for and receiving SSDI benefits, had conceded that she was [*48]  totally disabled." Id. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling.
The Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed. The court opined that the ADA and Social Security Act have differing definitions of disability. The ADA "defines a 'qualified individual with a disability' as a disabled person 'who . . . can perform the essential functions' of her job, including those who can do so only 'with . . . reasonable accommodation.'" Id. at 801 (citation omitted). The Social Security Act, by contrast, defines disability as an "'inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any . . . physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.'" Id. (citation omitted). Thus, "[b]y way of contrast, when the SSA determines whether an individual is disabled for SSDI purposes, it does not take the possibility of 'reasonable accommodation' into account, nor need an applicant refer to the possibility of reasonable accommodation when she applies for SSDI." Id. at 803 (emphasis original). "Further, the SSA sometimes grants SSDI benefits to individuals who not only can work, but are working." Id. at 805. The [*49]  Court thus held that there was no inherent contradiction between an application for social security disability benefits and an ADA disability discrimination claim. Id. at 806. It cautioned, however, that plaintiff must offer a sufficient explanation for any apparent contradiction between the benefits application and the disability discrimination claim so that "a reasonable juror[ could conclude] that, assuming the truth of, or the plaintiff's good-faith belief in, the earlier statement, the plaintiff could nonetheless 'perform the essential functions' of her job, with or without 'reasonable accommodation.'" Id.
Also instructive is the Ninth Circuit's decision in Fredenburg v. Contra Costa County Dep't of Health Services, 172 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 1999). There, the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment and held that the plaintiff-employee was not precluded from suing for disability discrimination because she had also applied for state disability benefits available to an employee who is "'unable to perform her regular or customary work.'" Id. at 1180. The court held that the requirements for the application of judicial estoppel were "simply not met" because
"Fredenburg was not playing fast and loose with, or committing fraud on, the court. Her case illustrates the [*50]  problems faced by a worker in her position. Her employer concluded that she could not perform her job, and placed her on unpaid leave. She disagreed with her employer's determination and unsuccessfully challenged it. Then, without pay because of her asserted disability, she applied for temporary disability benefits and received them. What else was she to do?" Id. at 1180-81.
The court noted that the employee "was also subject to different definitions of disability for the purpose of state benefits and the ADA." Id. at 1180. Specifically, it noted that "state law provided benefits if Fredenburg was unable to perform her regular or customary work, without regard to possible accommodation," while the "ADA require[d] only that Fredenburg be able to perform all of the essential functions of her job, with or without reasonable accommodation." Id. The court observed that its "ruling relieve[d] Fredenburg of an untenable choice between disability benefits and an ADA claim. . . ." Id. at 1181.
California decisions addressing the issue in the context of FEHA claims have reached similar results. In Prilliman v. United Air Lines, Inc., 53 Cal.App.4th 935, 62 Cal. Rptr. 2d 142 (1997), for example, the court rejected a judicial estoppel argument based on plaintiff's receipt of government and private disability benefits [*51]  for which inability to work was a prerequisite. Id. at 962. Prilliman, a pilot, received disability benefits because he had been grounded by his former employer, and had not been re-employed in a flight qualified position. Id. at 962-63. United argued that Prilliman's application for disability benefits barred him from showing that he was able to work because the application included a doctor's certification that he was "on permanent total disability." Id. at 963. The court disagreed, reasoning that this representation was not "inconsistent with" Prilliman's FEHA claims, because FEHA considers ability to work with accommodation, while the benefits criteria did not. Id.
In Bell v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA, 62 Cal.App.4th 1382, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 354 (1998), the court similarly rejected a judicial estoppel defense based on plaintiff's receipt of disability benefits during a time when he claimed he could have worked had he been provided an accommodation. Id. at 1386. The court opined that "the doctrine of judicial estoppel is not an invariable per se death sentence for plaintiff's lawsuit. The doctrine is invoked only after a very high threshold is cleared." Id. at 1387. It held that the doctrine was inapposite in the case before it because
"[i]t seems clear that plaintiff viewed himself as 'disabled' and incapable of performing [*52]  his customary duties solely because Wells Fargo [denied a continuing accommodation]. The accommodation in place from 1991 to 1993 not only allowed plaintiff to do his regular work, but to excel at it, to Wells Fargo's complete and repeatedly expressed satisfaction. The positions taken by plaintiff are thus not mutually exclusive; as has been pointed out in the ADA context, 'disability determinations take no account of reasonable accommodation.'" Id. at 1388 (citing Swanks v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Auth., 116 F.3d 582, 586, 325 U.S. App. D.C. 238 (D.C. Cir. 1997)).
Here, the same differing standards apply. To prevail on a FEHA disability discrimination claim, or a common law wrongful termination based on FEHA's policy against disability discrimination, "a plaintiff must establish [first that she] is a person with a disability within the meaning of the ADA." Sokol v. New United Motor Mfg., Inc., No. C 97-4211 SI, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6714, 2000 WL 1912724, *6 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 29, 2000). As noted, this includes a showing that plaintiff can perform the essential functions of her job with or without accommodation. See, e.g., Jensen, 85 Cal.App.4th at 255 n. 3 ("The term 'qualified individual' comes from the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. . . .) which defines 'qualified individual with a disability' as 'an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires'"). [*53]  To be eligible for SSA disability benefits, the applicant must be incapable of performing other work. See 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520. The SSA standard, however, takes into account the availability of such jobs. Specifically, it "look[s] at [the applicant's] ability to adjust to other work by considering [his] residual functional capacity and the vocational factors of age, education, and work experience, as appropriate in [his] case. Any other work (jobs) that [the applicant] can adjust to must exist in significant numbers in the national economy (either in the region where [he] live[s] or in several regions in the country). . . . In order to support a finding that [the applicant] [is] not disabled . . . , [the SSA must] . . . provid[e] evidence that demonstrates that other work exists in significant numbers in the national economy that [the applicant] can do, given [his] residual functional capacity and vocational factors." See 20 C.F.R. § 404.1560(c); Smith v. Hartford Life & Acc., No. C 11 03495 LB, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13868, 2013 WL 394185, *11 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 30, 2013) ("The ALJ also found that she has the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work . . . , except that she can engage in tasks requiring use of her hands frequently but not constantly, and that she retains the abilities to engage in simple, repetitive tasks equating to unskilled [*54]  work. . . . The ALJ further found that she could not perform her past relevant work . . . and that, considering her age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity, there are no jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that she can perform. Therefore, the ALJ found Ms. Smith 'disabled'"). Thus, an individual may be disabled under the SSA but not under the ADA. See Thornton v. Federal Express Corp., 530 F.3d 451, 455 (6th Cir. 2008) ("a disability determination by the Social Security Administration, even if substantiated, would not be controlling [in determining disability under the ADA]"); see also Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 804 (concluding that an individual who qualified for SSA disability benefits could fail to be substantially limited in performing major life activities under the ADA).
In addition, there is no evidence in the record concerning the representations Rodriguez made to the SSA. The court thus has no reason to require that he offer a sufficient explanation for apparent contradictions between his benefits application and disability discrimination claim. Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 806. For the same reason, Sugar Foods' reliance on Kennedy v. Applause, Inc., 90 F.3d 1477, 1481 (9th Cir. 1996), and Swonke v. Sprint, Inc., 327 F.Supp.2d 1128, 1135 (N.D. Cal. 2004) is unavailing. In Kennedy, plaintiff's doctor testified that she had become totally disabled beginning on January 11, 1993. Id. at 1481. The [*55]  court noted that statements plaintiff made on state disability and SSA claim forms "corroborate[d] [the doctor's] assessment that she was totally disabled [as of that date.] On the[ ] claim forms, Kennedy represented [that] she was completely disabled for all work-related purposes." Id. It concluded that plaintiff's "deposition testimony . . . in support of her ADA claim to the effect that she was not totally disabled [was] uncorroborated and self-serving[ and] . . . flatly contradict[ed] both her prior sworn statements and the medical evidence." It therefore held that "her deposition testimony [did] not present 'a sufficient [dispute concerning the facts] to require submission [of the ADA claim] to a jury.'" Id.
Similarly, in Swonke, the court - citing Kennedy - noted that notwithstanding the fact judicial estoppel did not apply, plaintiff had "the evidentiary problem of having made material factual statements as to his total disability and having acted in accordance. In other words, the problem is not that his positions are logically inconsistent, it is that he so consistently acted in accordance with being totally disabled." Swonke, 327 F.Supp.2d at 1135.
Here, there is no evidence as to what Rodriguez reported to the SSA; [*56]  the court thus cannot assess whether he made material factual statements regarding his purported "total disability." As noted, the evidence in the summary judgment record suggests Rodriguez could work with an accommodation; Rodriguez testified at his deposition that he would have been willing to return to Sugar Foods on "restricted light duty," which indicates he did not believe he was unable to work if he received an appropriate accommodation.94 In sum, Sugar Foods has not demonstrated that application of the judicial estoppel doctrine is warranted on the summary judgment record, or that summary judgment is otherwise warranted under the analysis in either Kennedy or Swonke.

(3) Conclusion Concerning Qualified Individual
For the reasons stated, neither Rodriguez's deposition testimony nor the fact that he applied for and received disability benefits from the SSA demonstrates that he has admitted he could not work. To the contrary, at his deposition, Rodriguez indicated that he would have been willing to return to work, and presumably therefore would have remained employed, at Sugar Foods with certain accommodations. Consequently, triable issues of fact remain as to whether Rodriguez is a qualified [*57]  individual. Accordingly, the court denies Sugar Foods' motion to the extent it is based on the fact that Rodriguez cannot prove he was not a qualified individual.

d. Whether Rodriguez Has Raised Triable Issues Regarding a Causal Link Between His Termination and His Disability/Protected Conduct
Sugar Foods also asserts that Rodriguez was not terminated because of his disability.95 It devotes a total of four lines in its motion to this argument and does not address the argument in reply. As noted, under Guz, to satisfy this element of a FEHA claim, Rodriguez need only cite facts indicating that "he suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available job," and that "some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive." 24 Cal.4th at 355.
There is no dispute that Rodriguez was terminated; the question is whether he has proffered sufficient evidence to support a finding of discriminatory motive. Looking first at Rodriguez's allegations of retaliation, there is no dispute that Grijalva and others at Sugar Foods knew Rodriguez had suffered a workplace injury and filed a worker's compensation claim on January 18, 2012. "As respects temporal proximity, the Ninth Circuit [*58]  has held that gaps of one to three months between a plaintiff's protected activity and a defendant's adverse employment action can give rise to an inference of causation." See Day, 930 F.Supp.2d at 1181 (citing Hernandez v. Spacelabs Med., Inc., 343 F.3d 1107, 1111, 1113 (9th Cir. 2003) (interval of less than a month between protected activity and adverse action sufficed to show causal link); Bell v. Clackamas County, 341 F.3d 858, 865-66 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that temporal proximity supported a finding of a causal link where plaintiff was placed on administrative leave approximately three weeks after complaining, was returned to duty and placed back on leave not quite three months after complaining and was ultimately terminated seven months after complaining); Yartzoff v. Thomas, 809 F.2d 1371, 1376 (9th Cir. 1987) (there was sufficient evidence of causation where adverse action was taken less than three months after a complaint was filed, two weeks after the charge was first investigated, and less than two months after the investigation ended). Here, there was a gap of just over one month between Rodriguez's workers compensation claim and his termination. This suffices to raise triable issues of fact concerning causation on Rodriguez's wrongful termination claim premised on retaliation in violation of FEHA.
Rodriguez argues that he also satisfies his burden with respect to his allegations of [*59]  discrimination because he was injured on January 6, 2012, Grijalva was aware of the injury the same day, and he was terminated - according to Sugar Foods' records - on February 29, 2012. Rodriguez notes that email correspondence between Barnum and Grijalva suggests he may have been terminated as early as February 22, 2012.96 The close proximity in time between Rodriguez's injury and the allegedly discriminatory discharge, combined with Sugar Foods' knowledge of Rodriguez's injury, is sufficient at this stage of the burden-shifting process to satisfy Rodriguez's prima facie burden on a discrimination claim. See Arteaga v. Brink's, Inc., 163 Cal.App.4th 327, 353, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654 (2008) ("Because the employee's burden of establishing a prima facie case . . . is fairly minimal, the temporal proximity between an employee's disclosure of his symptoms and a subsequent termination may satisfy the causation requirement at the first step of the burden-shifting process" (emphasis original)); see also McInteer v. Ashley Distribution Servs., Ltd., 40 F. Supp. 3d 1269, 2014 WL 4105262 (C.D. Cal., 2014) ("Plaintiff contends that the coincidence in timing between his medical leave and termination and between investigation into the complaints and his colonoscopy demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination. . . . Because an 'employee need only offer sufficient circumstantial [*60]  evidence to give rise to a reasonable inference of discrimination,' the Court finds that these facts are sufficient to establish a prima facie case that Plaintiff was subjected to adverse employment action because of his disability"); Diaz v. Fed. Express Corp., 373 F.Supp.2d 1034, 1064 (C.D. Cal. 2005) ("Although Defendant may have fired Plaintiff because of his absences, Plaintiff alleges that his absences were caused by his mental condition. Thus, if the trier of fact finds that Plaintiff's condition constituted a disability for purposes of the FEHA, and if the trier of fact believes that Plaintiff's absences were caused by that disability, Plaintiff will have established that Defendant's termination of Plaintiff was an adverse employment action taken because of Plaintiff's disability"); accord Maxwell v. Verde Valley Ambulance Co. Inc., No. CV 13-08044 PCT BSB, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127370, 2014 WL 4470512, *9 (D. Ariz. Sept. 11, 2014) ("Here, Plaintiff disclosed his disability and requested an accommodation on May 16, 2011, and he was terminated two weeks later. On summary judgment all inferences from the evidence must be construed in favor of the non-moving party and, therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of discrimination [under the ADA]. Although the evidence is not strong, Plaintiff has produced sufficient evidence to establish a genuine issue [*61]  of material fact that he was terminated because of his disability").97 Because Rodriguez's workplace injury and his termination were in close temporal proximity to one another, he has adduced sufficient evidence of causation to survive summary judgment on his claim for wrongful termination in violation of the public policy against discrimination set forth in FEHA.
In sum, Rodriguez has adduced sufficient evidence to satisfy his prima facie burden with respect to causation for both his discrimination and retaliation claims. Sugar Foods' motion for summary judgment on this basis must therefore be denied.

e. Whether Sugar Foods Has Proffered Evidence of a Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Reason for Terminating Rodriguez
Having determined that Sugar Foods' is not entitled to summary judgment on the ground that Rodriguez failed to establish a prima facie case, the court addresses whether Sugar Foods has met its burden under McDonnell Douglas. "To meet this burden, 'the defendant must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence,' reasons for its employment decision which, if believed by the trier of fact, would support a finding that the employment action was not a result of unlawful discrimination." [*62]  Noyes v. Kelly Servs., 488 F.3d 1163, 1169 (9th Cir. 2007) (quoting Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 255, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). Sugar Foods argues it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Rodriguez's employment, because he violated the company's "nocall/ no-show policy and abandoned his job."98 This evidence satisfies Sugar Foods' burden of producing admissible evidence of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Rodriguez. See id.

f. Whether Rodriguez Has Raised Triable Issues of Fact Concerning Pretext
Because Sugar Foods "satisfied its burden [of] articulat[ing] a nondiscriminatory reason for its [termination] decision, the burden shift[s] back to [Rodriguez] to come forward with evidence that the proffered reason[ ] [was] a pretext for discrimination." Id. (citing McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804). This shift does not place a new burden of production on the plaintiff. Raad v. Fairbanks N. Star Borough Sch. Dist., 323 F.3d 1185, 1194 (9th Cir. 2003), amended. 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 8688, 2003 WL 21027351 (9th Cir. 2003). Rather, "the factfinder may infer 'the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination' without additional proof once the plaintiff has made out her prima facie case if the factfinder rejects the employer's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons as unbelievable." Id.
"[A] plaintiff can prove pretext in two ways: (1) indirectly, by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is 'unworthy of credence' because it is internally [*63]  inconsistent or otherwise not believable, or (2) directly, by showing that unlawful discrimination more likely motivated the employer." Noyes, 488 F.3d at 1170 (emphasis original; quoting Chuang v. Univ. of California Davis, Bd. of Trustees, 225 F.3d 1115, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000)); Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 363 ("[I]n an appropriate case, an inference of dissembling may arise where the employer has given shifting, contradictory, implausible, uninformed, or factually baseless justifications for its actions"). Circumstantial evidence must be "specific" and "substantial." Dep't of Fair Emp't & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 746 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Godwin, 150 F.3d at 1221). An employee cannot meet his burden by simply showing that the employer's decision was "wrong, mistaken, or unwise." Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d at 746 (quoting Morgan v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 88 Cal.App.4th 52, 75, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 652 (2000)). "Rather, the employee must demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence . . . and hence infer that the employer did not act for the . . . non-discriminatory reasons." Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d at 746 (quoting Morgan, 88 Cal.App.4th at 75). "All of the evidence [concerning pretext] - whether direct or indirect - is to be considered cumulatively." Raad, 323 F.3d at 1194.
Sugar Foods contends Rodrgiuez cannot raise triable issues of fact concerning pretext.99 None of the evidence Rodriguez proffers is direct; it is all [*64]  circumstantial. He contends Grijalva admitted that his investigation as to whether it was appropriate to terminate Rodriguez for violation of the no-call/noshow policy involved "consideration of the expenses [Sugar Foods was] incurring[,] such as medical treatment and doctor's visits."100 He testified:
"I did my due diligence in speaking with him and being very clear about, you know, once you report an injury, we're taking accountability for the injury in terms of sending you, paying for the treatment, paying for the visits. And if at any point, you know, you don't make your part of the agreement, which is going to any of the appointments, we're in a tough spot, because we can't help you improve. And we're not able to manage, you know, your injury, which is our responsibility."101
Sugar Foods suggests the only reasonable interpretation of this statement is that Grijalva was trying to help Rodriguez regain his health. Rodrgiuez argues that it constitutes circumstantial evidence, albeit not overwhelming, of the fact that Sugar Foods' explanation is pretextual, and that it fired Rodriguez to avoid having to pay for his medical bills. He contends Grijalva's concession that "[i]f [Rodriguez is] [*65]  on workers' comp disability, then there is a cost that Sugar Foods isn't making directly, but . . .which eventually tri[ckles] back to Sugar Foods,"102 makes the motive clear. The court is not convinced that Grijavla's testimony is evidence of a discriminatory motive. As Sugar Foods argues, he simply told Rodriguez that Sugar Foods was paying for his medical care, and in exchange, Rodriguez needed to appear for scheduled doctor's appointments. The court agrees, however, that the fact Sugar Foods was incurring medical costs could be relevant in determining motive if coupled with other facts that suggest discriminatory intent.
Citing Chuang, 225 F.3d at 1127, Rodriguez also argues there is "specific and substantial" evidence "to show that [Sugar Foods'] proffered motives were not the actual motives because they are inconsistent or otherwise not believable." He contends that Sugar Foods engaged in a scheme in which it made it appear that he was not calling in and not manifesting an intent to return to work when he in fact was. Rodriguez cites the fact Grijalva sent a letter to his Los Angeles County address on February 6, 2012, stating that he had missed U.S. Healthworks appointments and that his supervisors [*66]  had not heard from him, despite having been told that Rodriguez was staying in San Diego with his mother on February 1, 2012.103 Rodriguez suggests this demonstrates that Sugar Foods was created a record they knew Rodriguez would never see so that it would have a pretext to terminate him.
Additionally, Rodriguez cites the fact that one of his supervisors, David Ayala, told him that he should be talking to human resources - in other words, to Grijalva - about when to return to work. Ayala corroborated this, stating that a decision as to when Rodriguez could come back to work after his injury "would probably [have] be[en] handled by Ronald [Grijalva] in HR, because he has a copy of [Rodriguez's work status report], . . . and . . . one of the supervisors, Jerry or myself[,] . . . [w]ould have to call Mr. Rodriguez."104 Rodriguez maintains that he was trying to speak to Grijalva "on a daily basis, maybe every day."105 He contends, however, that he was unable to do so because Grijalva avoided him. He testified:
"I left him messages when he wouldn't speak with me because I could hear him in the room, but according to his assistant, he wouldn't be in the room. I would leave messages, messages, messages, [*67]  and when he'll get back to me, he'll tell me what's going on, did I get ahold of my supervisors, and then I'll tell him that they told me to talk to him. It was a circle, you know. It was just a circle going back and forth, back and forth."106
Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Rodriguez, a reasonable factfinder could determine that Sugar Foods used Rodriguez's purported violation of the no-call/no-show policy as a pretext to terminate him. A rational jury could determine that on January 19, 2012, Rodriguez was told to come back when he was feeling better,107 and that Rodriguez was later told to direct all correspondence to Grijalva. The jury could also find that Grijalva attempted to make a record that he could use to discharge Rodriguez by sending no-show/no-call letters to an address at which he knew Rodriguez was not staying, and avoided his telephone calls despite knowledge that Rodriguez was trying to reach him. Rodriguez also testified that when he was able to speak with Grijalva, "not [ ] once did he mention coming back with restrictions."108 Rodriguez maintains that instead, Grijalva "basically said, You coming back? When are you ready to come back and jump on the [*68]  forklift?" Rodriguez construed this to mean that Grijalva meant Rodriguez would not be given light duty.109 Crediting this testimony, the jury could find that Sugar Foods declined to accommodate Rodriguez, and could view this as further evidence of discriminatory motive.
If the jury chooses to credit Rodriguez's account, it could rationally conclude that Rodriguez had produced specific and substantial evidence showing that Sugar Foods' stated reason was the actual reason he was terminated, because it is "not believable" in light of the totality of circumstances surrounding his injury and termination. Chuang, 225 F.3d at 1127. Consequently, factual issues remain as to whether Sugar Foods wrongfully terminated Rodriguez in violation of the public policies against discrimination and retaliation articulated in FEHA. Its motion for summary judgment must therefore be denied.

g. Conclusion Regarding Wrongful Termination Claims Premised on Disability Discrimination and Retaliation
For the reasons stated, there are triable issues of fact as to whether Rodriguez is a qualified individual under FEHA, and whether he was terminated because of his disability or because he engaged in the protected activity of filing [*69]  a workers compensation claim. Thus, although Sugar Foods satisfied its burden of providing a legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for terminating Rodriguez, Rodriguez has met his burden of adducing evidence that raises triable issues of fact as to whether Sugar Foods' explanation is merely pretextual. Sugar Foods' motion for summary judgment on Rogriguez's wrongful termination claims must therefore be denied.

D. Rodriguez's Constitutional Claim
Rodriguez's sixth claim alleges violation of Article 1, Section 8 of the California Constitution. This section states that a "person may not be disqualified from entering or pursuing a business, profession, vocation, or employment because of sex, race, creed, color, or national or ethnic origin." CAL. CONST., art. I, § 8. Sugar Foods argues that this claim must be dismissed because there is no evidence that Rodriguez was terminated on the basis of his sex, race, creed, color, or national or ethnic origin.110 Rodriguez does not address the claim in his opposition.111 The court is aware of no evidence Sugar Foods terminated Rodriguez on the basis of his sex, race, creed, color, or national or ethnic origin. The court therefore grants summary judgment in Sugar Foods' favor on this claim.

E. Rodriguez's Intentional Infliction [*70]  of Emotional Distress Claim (IIED)
To state an IIED claim under California law, a plaintiff must prove "(1) that the defendant's conduct was outrageous, (2) that the defendant intended to cause or recklessly disregarded the probability of causing emotional distress, and (3) that the plaintiff's severe emotional suffering was (4) actually and proximately caused by defendant's conduct." Austin v. Terhune, 367 F.3d 1167, 1172 (9th Cir. 2004). Sugar Foods argues that Rodriguez cannot establish extreme and outrageous conduct, and that he cannot prove that he has suffered severe emotional distress.112

1. Whether Rodriguez Has Raised Triable Issues of Fact Concerning Extreme and Outrageous Conduct
"Conduct to be outrageous must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community." Christensen v. Superior Court, 54 Cal.3d 868, 903, 2 Cal. Rptr. 2d 79, 820 P.2d 181 (1991) (quoting Davidson v. City of Westminster, 32 Cal.3d 197, 209, 185 Cal. Rptr. 252, 649 P.2d 894 (1982)). "The defendant must have engaged in 'conduct intended to inflict injury or engaged in with the realization that injury will result.'" Id. Sugar Foods contends Rodriguez cannot establish extreme and outrageous conduct because he cannot identify any conduct in which it engaged that exceeded the bounds of what is tolerated in a civilized society. Rodriguez counters that he bases his IIED claim on injury-related workplace discrimination, [*71]  and hence that he has demonstrated extreme and outrageous conduct. California's workers' compensation law provides the exclusive remedy for workplace injuries. See Shoemaker v. Myers, 52 Cal.3d 1, 19-20, 276 Cal. Rptr. 303, 801 P.2d 1054 (1990). "That limitation does not apply, however, when the injury is a result of conduct, whether in the form of discharge or otherwise, not seen as reasonably coming within the compensation bargain." Kovatch v. California Cas. Mgmt. Co., 65 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1267, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 217 (1998).
The California Supreme Court has repeatedly held that "when the misconduct attributed to the employer is actions which are a normal part of the employment relationship, such as demotions, promotions, criticism of work practices, and frictions in negotiations as to grievances, an employee suffering emotional distress causing disability may not avoid the exclusive remedy provisions of the [workers' compensation law] by characterizing the employer's decisions as manifestly unfair, outrageous, harrassment, or intended to cause emotional disturbance resulting in disability." Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Prot. Dist., 43 Cal.3d 148, 160, 233 Cal. Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743 (1987); Accardi v. Superior Court, 17 Cal.App.4th 341, 352, 21 Cal. Rptr. 2d 292 (1993) ("Emotional distress caused by misconduct in employment relations involving, for example, promotions, demotions, criticism of work practices, negotiations as to grievances, is a normal part of the employment environment. A cause of action for such a claim is barred [*72]  by the exclusive remedy provisions of the workers' compensation law."), disapproved on other grounds in Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc., 26 Cal.4th 798, 813-23, 111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 87, 29 P.3d 175 (2001).
"The [California] Legislature, however, did not intend that an employer be allowed to raise the exclusivity rule for the purpose of deflecting a claim of discriminatory practices. Thus, a claim for emotional and psychological damage, arising out of employment, is not barred where the distress is engendered by an employer's illegal discriminatory practices." Accardi, 17 Cal.App.4th at 352; see also Dicks v. Rolm Co., 187 F.3d 646 (9th Cir. 1999) ("[I]f Defendant terminated her benefits in violation of public policy or of federal anti-discrimination statutes, then Defendant's conduct would be outside the 'compensation bargain'"); Fretland v. County of Humboldt, 69 Cal.App.4th 1478, 1492, 82 Cal. Rptr. 2d 359 (1999) ("[W]ork-related injury discrimination is not a normal risk of the compensation bargain. . . . Thus, Fretland's emotional distress claims are not barred by the exclusivity rule to the extent they seek emotional distress damages for the alleged work-related injury discrimination"). Accordingly, workers' compensation law exclusivity does not bar Rodriguez's IIED claim.
Citing Janken v. GM Hughes Electronics, 46 Cal.App.4th 55, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 741 (1996), Sugar Foods contends that Rodriguez's IIED claim nonetheless fails because the conduct at issue was not sufficiently extreme and outrageous to justify relief. [*73]  In Janken, employees of a large aircraft company sued their supervisors for age discrimination and for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Id. at 61-62. Plaintiffs alleged the supervisors made personnel management decisions pursuant to a company policy of discriminating against employees over forty years of age by terminating them or forcing them to resign without good cause. Id. The Court of Appeal affirmed trial court rulings sustaining demurrers to both causes of action.
With respect to the emotional distress claim, the Janken court held that plaintiffs failed to plead facts satisfying the outrageous conduct requirement. It reasoned: "Managing personnel is not outrageous conduct beyond the bounds of human decency, but rather conduct essential to the welfare and prosperity of society. A simple pleading of personnel management activity is insufficient to support a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, even if improper motivation is alleged. If personnel management decisions are improperly motivated, the remedy is a suit against the employer for discrimination." Id. at 64.
Janken illustrates the rule that the conduct itself, not the alleged motive for that conduct, must be outrageous to satisfy [*74]  the first element of the emotional distress tort. See id.; Walker v. Boeing Corp., 218 F.Supp.2d 1177, 1190 (C.D. Cal. 2002) ("Terminating an employee for improper or discriminatory reasons, like many other adverse personnel management decisions, is insufficiently extreme or outrageous to give rise to a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress"); Helgeson v. Am. Int'l Group, Inc., 44 F.Supp.2d 1091, 1095 (S.D. Cal. 1999) (holding that, even if the employer's actions were improperly motivated, every-day management decisions fell "far short of the necessary standard of outrageous conduct beyond all bounds of decency"); Regents of Unversity of California v. Superior Court, No. A096423, 2002 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 4414, 2002 WL 120818, *4 (Cal. App. Jan. 30, 2002) (Unpub. Disp.) ("Janken illustrates a more fundamental rule: The conduct itself, not the alleged motive for that conduct, must be outrageous in order to satisfy the first element of the emotional distress tort").113
Here, the conduct on which Rodriguez bases his IIED claim is the same conduct underlying his wrongful termination claims. He contends that Sugar Foods: "(1) told [him] to refrain from filing a claim for his on-the-job injury; (2) ordered [him] to go home and bring back a doctor's note for his injury; (3) did not send [him] to the clinic until some 12 days later; (4) did not authorize [his] request to visit a different clinic; (5) refused to extend [his] reasonable request for accommodation [*75]  in the form of [an] extended leave of absence despite company policy; (6) refused to offer modified duties when [he] requested such; (7) pushed [him] to resign voluntarily; (8) denied [his] workers' compensation claim; (9) falsely claimed that [he] had abandoned his job 'without notice,' on [his] unemployment insurance claim form, which resulted in [his] claim being denied; and (10) knowingly sent notices to [his] old address and then claimed that [he] was not communicating with [Sugar Foods] and was thus a no show/no call and that he had abandoned his job."114
There is no evidence that Sugar Foods "told [Rodriguez] to refrain from filing a claim for his on-the-job injury" or that it "pushed [him] to voluntarily resign." Likewise, there is little evidence concerning the filing of a worker's compensation claim, and no evidence Rodriguez was told not to file one. The court therefore declines to consider these assertions. Each of the remaining actions Rodriguez challenges is a management-related decision; thus, although they may reflect a discriminatory motive, under well-established California case law, they do not suffice to raise triable issues of fact concerning an IIED claim. Because [*76]  Rodriguez has not adduced evidence that Sugar Foods engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct, the court grants summary judgment in favor of Sugar Foods on his IIED claim.

2. Whether Rodriguez Has Raised Triable Issues Concerning the Fact That He Suffered Severe Emotional Distress
Sugar Foods also argues that Rodriguez has not adduced evidence that he suffered severe emotional distress. "Severe emotional distress means emotional distress of such substantial quality or enduring quality that no reasonable [person] in civilized society should be expected to endure it." Kremer v. Zillow, Inc., No. CV 14-1889 DOC DFM, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12791, 2015 WL 438418, *4 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 3, 2015) (quoting Hughes v. Pair, 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1051, 95 Cal. Rptr. 3d 636, 209 P.3d 963 (2009)). In his opposition, Rodriguez argues that he suffers from "sleeplessness, crying, anxiety and panic attacks."115 This is not evidence of distress sufficiently severe to raise a triable issue on Rodriguez's IIED claim.
In Hughes, the California Supreme Court held that plaintiff's contention that she "suffered discomfort, worry, anxiety, upset stomach, concern, and agitation as the result of defendant's comments to her" failed to establish that she had suffered severe emotional distress. 46 Cal.4th at 1051. Similarly, in Lawler v. Montblanc N. Am., LLC, 704 F.3d 1235, 1246 (9th Cir. 2013), the Ninth Circuit held that plaintiff's testimony that she suffered from "[a]nxiety, [*77]  sleeplessness, upset stomach, [and] sometimes muscle twitches" did not establish that she suffered from conditions that were sufficiently severe to raise triable issues of fact. Id. Rodriguez's testimony that he suffers from sleeplessness, crying, anxiety and panic attacks is similar to the plaintiffs' allegations in Lawler and Hughes. Accordingly, these symptoms do not suffice to raise triable issues of fact concerning on severe emotional distress.
Rodriguez also contends that he now suffers from high blood pressure.116 Sugar Foods disputes that there is any evidence linking Rodriguez's alleged high blood pressure to any extreme and outrageous conduct in which it engaged. It argues that Rodriguez's deposition testimony demonstrates beyond dispute that he suffers from high blood pressure as a result of his back injury.117 The court must agree. The only evidence concerning Rodriguez's high blood pressure in the summary judgment record is his deposition testimony on the subject. There, he stated clearly and unequivocally on two occasions that the high blood pressure he is now experiencing resulted from his back injury. He first stated: "The back injury led to the high blood pressure." He later said: "I'm [*78]  telling you, out of my lower back, high blood pressure came out."118 Rodriguez submits no other evidence linking his high blood pressure to Sugar Foods' purportedly outrageous actions; hence, he cannot rely on his high blood pressure as evidence that he is suffering severe emotional distress. For this reason too, Sugar Foods' motion for summary judgment must be granted.

F. Rodriguez's Claim for Lost Wages
Sugar Foods also asserts that it is entitled to summary judgment on Rodriguez's prayer for lost wages. It contends Rodriguez had a duty to take steps to minimize his losses by making a reasonable effort to find comparable employment. This is correct. See Stanchfield v. Hamer Toyota, Inc., 37 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1501, 44 Cal. Rptr. 2d 565 (1995) (quoting a jury instruction the court approved as follows: "An employee who was damaged as a result of a breach of an employment contract by the employer, has a duty to take steps to minimize the loss by making a reasonable effort to find and retain comparable employment. If the employee through reasonable efforts could have found and retained comparable employment, any amount that the employee could reasonably have earned by obtaining and retaining comparable employment through reasonable efforts shall be deducted from the amount [*79]  of damages awarded to employee" (emphasis omitted)). Here, there is no dispute that, apart from one "survey" Rodriguez completed on the internet that purportedly became a Target job application, he did not seek new employment after being terminated.119 He said he did not do so because he did not believe anyone would hire him.120
"The general rule is that the measure of recovery by a wrongfully discharged employee is the amount of salary agreed upon for the period of service, less the amount which the employer affirmatively proves the employee has earned or with reasonable effort might have earned from other employment. However, before projected earnings from other employment opportunities not sought or accepted by the discharged employee can be applied in mitigation, the employer must show that the other employment was comparable, or substantially similar, to that of which the employee has been deprived; the employee's rejection of or failure to seek other available employment of a different or inferior kind may not be resorted to in order to mitigate damages." Parker v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., 3 Cal.3d 176, 89 Cal. Rptr. 737, 474 P.2d 689 (1970).
"[The Ninth Circuit has] recognized that under California law, '[t]he employer bears the burden of proving that 'comparable, or [*80]  substantially similar,' employment was available to the employee; the employee is not required to prove mitigation.'" Boehm v. Am. Broad. Co., 929 F.2d 482, 485 (9th Cir. 1991) (citing Kern v. Levolor Lorentzen, Inc., 899 F.2d 772, 778 (9th Cir. 1990)). Under this standard, it was incumbent on Sugar Foods to offer evidence that comparable employment was available to Rodriguez. Sugar Foods has not met its burden in this regard. Id. ("No expertise or judicial notice is required in order to hold that the deprivation or infringement of an employee's rights held under an original employment contract converts the available 'other employment' relied upon by the employer to mitigate damages, into inferior employment which the employee need not seek or accept"). Sugar Foods' motion for summary judgment on this issue is therefore denied.121

G. Rodriguez's Claim for Punitive Damages
Finally, Sugar Foods argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Rodriguez's punitive damages prayer. It argues he has adduced no evidence that would support a finding of fraud, oppression, or malice by an officer, director, or managing agent of Sugar Foods, as required under California law.122
Punitive damages are awarded not to compensate a tort victim but to punish persons "'guilty of recklessness or wickedness.'" White v. Ultramar, Inc., 21 Cal.4th 563, 569, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944 (1999) (quoting Warner v. Southern Pacific Co., 113 Cal. 105, 112, 45 P. 187 (1896)). "Punitive [*81]  damages are awarded only where there is malice, oppression, or fraud, defined [essentially] to mean intent to injure or willful and conscious disregard of others' rights." Cruz v. HomeBase, 83 Cal.App.4th 160, 167, 99 Cal. Rptr. 2d 435 (2000). "Corporations are legal entities which do not have minds capable of recklessness, wickedness, or intent to injure or deceive. An award of punitive damages against a corporation therefore must rest on the malice of the corporation's employees." Id. To that end, California Civil Code § 3294(b) provides:
"An employer shall not be liable for damages pursuant to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee of the employer, unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(b).
Under § 3294(b), Rodriguez can prove an entitlement to punitive damages only if he can show that an officer, director, or [*82]  "managing agent" of Sugar Foods acted with conscious disregard. As the Cruz court stated:
"This is the group whose intentions guide corporate conduct. By so confining liability, the statute avoids punishing the corporation for malice of low-level employees which does not reflect the corporate 'state of mind' or the intentions of corporate leaders. This assures that punishment is imposed only if the corporation can be fairly be viewed as guilty of the evil intent sought to be punished. '[T]o award [punitive] damages against the master for the criminality of the servant is to punish a man for that of which he is not guilty.'" Cruz, 83 Cal.App.4th at 167.
Rodriguez maintains that Sugar Foods can be held liable if one of its employees acts with ill will or actual malice at the express direction of a "superior official" having power to bind the corporation.123 He does not identify any employee of Sugar Foods who was such a "superior official," however. Instead, he refers simply to "defendant." It would appear, however, that he bases his punitive damages prayer on Grijalva's conduct, as Grijalva was the individual he attempted to contact, who allegedly gave him the "run around" about returning to work, and who ultimately fired [*83]  him. There is no evidence that Grijalva is a director or officer of Sugar Foods; the only evidence is that Grijalva is Sugar Foods' "Senior Human Resources manager."124 The question, therefore, is whether this suffices to make him a managing agent.
"'Managing agents' are employees who 'exercise [ ] substantial discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy.'" Cruz, 83 Cal.App.4th at 167 (quoting White, 21 Cal.4th at 573). "'Corporate policy' is not defined by statute, nor in the case law relating to punitive damages." Id. The Courts of Appeal have held, "[b]y analogy to [case law and dictionary] definitions, [that] 'corporate policy' is the general principles which guide a corporation, or rules intended to be followed consistently over time in corporate operations." Accordingly, a "managing agent" is "one with substantial authority over decisions that set these general principles and rules." Id. at 167-78.
In White, the Court found that a regional director "responsible for managing eight stores, including two stores in the San Diego area, and at least sixty-five employees" was a managing agent. 21 Cal.4th at 577. It noted that the "individual store managers reported to her, and [she] reported to department heads in the corporation's retail [*84]  management department." Id. The Court concluded that "[t]he supervision of eight retail stores and sixty-five employees [wa]s a significant aspect of [the employer's] business[, and the] testimony of [the regional director's] superiors establishe[d] that they delegated most, if not all, of the responsibility for running these stores to her." Id.
In Cruz, the court held that the individual whom plaintiff identified as a managing agent was "a supervisor subordinate to the store manager in a single outlet of a multi-store chain. He supervised only a few employees, and had authority over only one narrow area of the single store's multifaceted operations: security. There was not a hint of evidence that he exercised authority over corporate principles or rules of general application in the corporation." Cruz, 83 Cal.App.4th at168. The court noted it was "true that, despite his limited sphere of authority, [the supervisor's] decisions could have significant consequences, as the [litigation at issue] show[ed]." It held, however, that such considerations were not relevant, stating: "[E]very corporate employee's reckless or malicious conduct has the potential to cause serious injury. Whether the corporation will be liable [*85]  for punitive damages depends, not on the nature of the consequences, but rather on whether the malicious employee belongs to the leadership group of 'officers, directors, and managing agents.'" Id.
Other "California courts have held that an individual is not a managing agent if there is no evidence presented that [he was] 'engaged in policy making' for the corporation." Kelsey v. Allstate Ins. Co., No. CV 04-01224 RMW, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50707, 2005 WL 1773302, *11 (N.D. Cal. July 26, 2005) (quoting Kelly-Zurian v. Wohl Shoe Co., 22 Cal.App.4th 397, 422, 27 Cal. Rptr. 2d 457 (1994)). In Kelly-Zurian, plaintiff argued that an employee of the defendant company had immediate and direct control over her work as well as responsibility for supervising her performance. 22 Cal.App.4th at 422. The court concluded, however, that the "fact [plaintiff] reported to [the employer's agent] and that he had the authority to terminate her merely reflect[ed the fact that the purported managing agent] was Zurian's supervisor, not that he was a managing agent." Id. The court observed additionally: "Not only did Zurian failed to present any evidence to show Lawicki was in a policy making position, but Wohl presented substantial evidence to the contrary. [Another employee] testified [that the purported managing agent] did not 'have authority to change or establish business policy for Fanfares in Southern California[.]'" Id. It therefore held [*86]  that because plaintiff had adduced no "substantial evidence that [the purported managing agent] was involved in setting company policy . . . , the record established [that he] was not a managing agent." Id.
Here, the court agrees with Sugar Foods that Rodriguez has not adduced evidence that would support a finding that Grijalva was a managing agent. Rodriguez proffers no evidence that Grijalva has "substantial authority over decisions that set [ ]general [corporate] principles and rules." Cruz, 83 Cal.App.4th at167-68.
In contrast to White, there is no evidence that employees "reported to [Grijalva], [or that he] reported to department heads in [Sugar Foods'] management department." 21 Cal.4th at 577. Nor is there evidence of the number of employees Grijalva oversaw, or how much, if any, discretion had been delegated to him. Id. To be sure, there is evidence that Rodriguez reported his injury to Grijalva, and that Grijalva had the authority to terminate him. As Kelly-Zurian teaches, however, the "fact [Rodriguez] reported to [Grijalva] and that he had the authority to terminate [him]" does not demonstrate that Grijalva was a managing agent, and is, in fact, consistent with supervisory authority only. 22 Cal.App.4th at 422. This case is substantially similar to Kelly-Zurian; here, [*87]  as there, there is no evidence that Grijalva had substantial authority over decisions that set general corporate principles. Grijalva states in his declaration that he "has never had substantial discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy" at Sugar Foods.125 The only evidence Rodriguez cites disputing this is the fact that Grijalva purportedly consulted "a company attorney" before deciding to terminate him.126 The fact that such a consultation occurred does not demonstrate that Grijalva had substantial discretionary authority; to some degree, in fact, it cuts against such a finding, inasmuch as it may indicate that Grijalva was constrained even in making the termination decision. Cruz and Kelly-Zurian, moreover, make clear that merely having authority to terminate an employee is not sufficient to render someone a managing agent. Where, as here, the record lacks sufficient evidence to support a finding that an employee that allegedly engaged in malicious conduct is a managing agent, summary judgment on a prayer for punitive damages is proper. See Martinez v. Rite Aid Corp., No. B228621, 2013 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2832, 2013 WL 1735550, *24-25 (Cal. App. Apr. 23, 2013) (Unpub. Disp.) ("Martinez relies exclusively on the testimony of Acosta who stated that, based on his individual dealings [*88]  with human resources managers, he believed they had the authority to determine human resources policies and how they applied in his district. However, Acosta later testified that the officers of Rite Aid were the only ones who determined the policies and procedures for his district, and when asked about the basis for his understanding as to whether human resources managers set corporate policy, Acosta responded that a human resources manager was not an officer of the company. Thus, while Granillo clearly denied that he had any policy-making authority, Acosta's testimony about the role of a human resources manager in determining corporate policy was ambiguous. Even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Martinez, Acosta's testimony, standing alone, was insufficient to support a finding that Granillo was a managing agent. . . . In sum, there was no substantial evidence to support a finding that any officer, director, or managing agent of Rite Aid either participated in the alleged malicious conduct or had actual knowledge of the malicious conduct and thereafter ratified it. The jury's verdict awarding punitive damages to Martinez must therefore be reversed"); Cruz, 83 Cal.App.4th at 168 (reversing [*89]  a jury's punitive damages award where "there was no evidence that Kinsel was an officer or director, and the evidence was insufficient, as a matter of law, to show that Kinsel was a managing agent"); Kelly-Zurian, 22 Cal.App.4th at 422 ("Because Zurian failed to present any substantial evidence that Lawicki was involved in setting company policy for Wohl, the record established Lawicki was not a managing agent. The trial court therefore properly denied Zurian's motion for a new trial against Wohl on the issue of punitive damages.").
Consequently, the court grants summary judgment in Sugar Foods' favor on Rodriguez's punitive damages prayer.

III. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated, Sugar Foods' motion for summary judgment is granted in part and denied in part. The court denies Sugar Foods' motion for summary judgment on Rodriguez's claims for wrongful termination in violation of the public policies prohibiting disability discrimination and retaliation set forth in FEHA. It also denies Sugar Foods' motion for summary judgment on Rodriguez's prayer for lost wages. The court grants summary judgment in favor of Sugar Foods on Rodriguez's failure to accommodate and failure to participate in the interactive process claims, given [*90]  that they are statutory FEHA claims as to which he failed to exhaust administrative remedies; on Rodriguez's IIED claim; and on his punitive damages prayer.
