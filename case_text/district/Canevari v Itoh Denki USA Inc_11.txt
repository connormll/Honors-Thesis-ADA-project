REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

I. INTRODUCTION
This action presents a dispute between the plaintiff, Jeffrey Canevari, and his former employer, Itoh Denki U.S.A., Inc. The plaintiff has alleged that Itoh Denki discriminated against him in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act "(ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act ("PHRA"), 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. §§ 951 et seq. when it terminated his employment after learning that he may have a physical impairment to his back, and a day after the plaintiff notified the defendant of a scheduled doctor's appointment. The defendant strongly disputes this characterization, arguing that it fired Canevari because his performance as a salesman had become unacceptable, and after learning that the plaintiff had largely ignored an important customer. The defendant further argues that the plaintiff has not come forward [*2]  with evidence to carry his burden of demonstrating even a prima facie case of discrimination, much less to show evidence that the company fired Canevari because of his asserted physical disability. The defendant has moved for summary judgment on the claims, and the motion is fully briefed and ripe for adjudication. Mindful of the fact that Mindful of the fact that it is emphatically not the province of the court to weigh evidence, or assess credibility, when passing upon a motion for summary judgment, for the reasons that follow, it will be recommended that the motion be denied with respect to all claims except for the plaintiff's standalone failure-to-accommodate claim.

II. BACKGROUND
The background to this report and recommendation is taken from the factual record that the parties have developed in their moving papers, and viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff as the non-moving party. While there is agreement regarding much of the background to this action, the parties disagree sharply on certain facts, and on their relevance to the claims asserted.
Jeffrey Canaveri began his employment with Itoh Denki on June 10, 2013, as a sales representative. (Doc. 42, Ex. A., Deposition [*3]  of Jeffrey Canaveri ("Canaveri Dep.") at 16:13-16.) Itoh Denki is a company that manufactures conveyor products. The company consists of more than 20 employees, including four sales representatives who are separated nationally and each assigned territories. (Doc., Ex. B, Deposition of Rich Kosik ("Kosik Dep.") at 12:3-14:22.) Rich Kosik is the President of Itoh Denki's United States operations, and is responsible for production, engineering, and sales. (Id. at 4:13-16, 8:5-8, 10:4-10.) When Canevari was hired, he reported directly to Kosik, who was the Senior Vice President for Sales at the time. (Kosik Dep. at 33:3-10.) While Canevari was training with the company, Kosik traveled with him to visit customers, and Kosik would travel to larger meetings with existing customers to discuss priority projects or on other top-level business. (Id. at 39:11-40:4.)
In August 2013, Kosik was promoted to President and assumed a variety of managerial roles outside of sales and engineering, and from August 2013 through March of 2014, Itoh Denki did not have anyone in place as National and Sales Marketing Manager. (Kosik Dep. at 37:19-24.) Prior to hiring Keith Evanosky in early 2014, Kosik continued [*4]  to supervise all sales representatives, although he did not have as much time to do so, and his travel in this regard was more limited. (Kosik Dep. at 35:9-16, 39:8-10.)
In his role as a sales representative, Canevari was responsible for selling to new clients, prospective clients, and existing clients. (Canevari Dep. at 20:16-19.) To assist him in his job duties, Canevari was provided with a list of leads from trade shows, which he was to use in an effort to develop new business from companies operating in his sales territory in the northeastern United States and Ontario (the "Northeast").1 (Id. at 18:9-17, 19:16-24.) Additionally, he was provided with a list of 350 Northeast customers, including contact information for each. (Id. at 18:22-19:15, 19:25-20:4; Doc. 42-1, Ex. E, Customer List.) This list consisted of prospective or existing clients. (Canevari Dep. at 20:5-10, 20:20-24.) Canevari was also expected to find and develop prospective or new clients on his own initiative. (Canevari Dep. at 20:5-10, 21:5-7.) To fulfill this aspect of his job, Canevari would research online and in books provided by Itoh Denki. (Canevari Dep. at 21:11-16.) Canevari attested that he understood that [*5]  is primary goal was to see as many new customers as possible, and to increase sales as much as he was able. (Id. at 21:17-25, 37:10-13.)
During the early stages of Canevari's employment with Itoh Denki, Kosik traveled with him to visit customers, including a major customer named Carter Controls. (Id. at 22:17-23.) Canevari also visited Carter Controls on one occasion after this initial visit with Kosik. (Id. at 26:24-27:13.)
The company's sales representatives were required to submit daily reports about their sales activities, identifying what each of them did during the day, the type of customer they met with, and what transpired at the meeting. (Id. at 36:8-37:1.) The sales representatives were also provided with a six-month report detailing the types of calls that they had been making. (Id. at 35:11-36:2; Doc. 42-1, Ex. G, Sales Call Analysis Reports.) Canevari used the information contained in this report in his effort to maintain balance between new and existing customers. (Canevari Dep. at 38:7-13.)
On March 10, 2014, Itoh Denki hired Keith Evanosky as its National Sales and Marketing Manager. (Doc. 42-1, Ex. C, Deposition of Keith Evanosky ("Evanosky Dep.") at 9:2-4; Kosik Dep. [*6]  at 35:17-22.) Upon being hired, Evanosky began supervising the sales representatives. (Kosik Dep. at 36:3-11.) During Evanosky's initial conversation with Canevari, Kosik introduced him and praised Canevari's job performance. Kosik indicated that Canevari was new to the company and was doing a good job opening up new business for the company. (Canevari Dep. at 33:4-12.)
Canevari and Evanosky attended a trade show in Atlanta, Georgia from March 16-20, 2014. (Evanosky Dep. at 70:14-21; Canevari Dep. at 28:2-8.) At the trade show, Canevari was expected to speak with as many people as possible while standing in Itoh Denki's display booth. (Canevari Dep. at 28:18-29:5.) During the trade show, Canevari met with employees of Carter Controls, and nobody indicated that Carter Controls had not heard from an Itoh Denki sales representative in the past few months. (Id. at 31:13-19; 32:12-17.)
It was at the trade show that Canevari's back began to bother him. At one point, Canevari asked Evanosky if he could sit down because his back was bothering him, to which Evanosky allegedly responded, "Are you crazy?" (Canevari Dep. at 55:18-56:1.) Canevari explained that his back was really bothering him, [*7]  and that his leg had gone numb and his hands were tingling, so he needed to sit. (Id. at 56:2-4; 57:14-58:12.) Evanosky, allegedly unmoved by this explanation, responded by stating "do you know how much money we spent on this? If you value your job, keep talking to customers. You can sit down tonight." (Id. at 56:5-8; 57:14-58:12.) According to Canevari, he persisted three or four times in asking to be accommodated by sitting, and Evanosky refused the requests. (Id. at 56:18-21.) Although there were chairs available nearby, Canevari elected to remain standing because he was afraid that if he sat down he would be putting his job at risk. (Id. at 56:23-57:9.)
The extended periods of standing at the trade show and on the train back to the airport caused Canevari significant pain, and resulted in him lagging behind Evanosky. (Id. at 60:22-61:7.) Evanosky acknowledged that the plaintiff complained that his leg had gone numb again on the train ride. (Evanosky Dep. at 26:9-27:1.) On the way home, Canevari explained that his back was bothering him and that he would eventually need to have surgery to fix it. According to Canevari, Evanosky responded by telling him "I won't keep you around for [*8]  [back surgery]." (Canevari Dep. at 61:8-17.) Evanosky recalls having a conversation with Canevari about his back, learning that he had a condition similar to scoliosis that had limited the plaintiff's activities, including golf. (Evanosky Dep. at 22:1-24.)
The exact condition that Canevari suffers from is Scheuermann's kyphosis, which is a severe curvature of the spine, which Canevari has had since he was 12 years old. (Canevari Dep. at 40:18-41:14.) This condition limits the plaintiff in a number of life activities, including standing, walking, bending, and sitting. (Id. at 51:1-7.) As a result of the condition, Canevari claims he can no longer golf, or fish or hunt, and the condition prevents him from remaining in the same sitting, standing, or laying position for an extended period of time. (Id. at 51-52.) If he has to stand for long periods, he experiences back pain, with shooting numbness down to this legs and feet, and he needs to sit on a chair or the floor. (Id. at 53:8-21.) The plaintiff's medical records indicate that his condition has remained more or less constant, and was continuing to treat with physicians for significant lower back pain resulting from the condition. (Doc. 42-1, Ex. [*9]  F.)
Upon returning from the trade show, things rapidly went downhill for Canevari in terms of his relationship with Itoh Denki. On March 27, 2014, he went to the doctor, where his medical notes reveal complaints for back pain and numbness in his legs. (Id. at P53.) Canevari scheduled another doctor's appointment for April 7, 2014, and he informed Evanosky about the appointment and the reason for it. (Canevari Dep. at 65-68.) He followed up with an email on April 5 reminding Evanosky of the appointment, which was the only doctor's appointment that Canevari told either Kosik or Evanosky about during his employment with the company. (Id. at 66-68.)
On April 8, the day after his doctor's visit, Canevari met with Evanosky and Kosik for a performance review. During that review, they informed Canevari that was being terminated for poor performance and because he did not visit with Carter Controls. (Id. at 71:18-23.) Canevari explained that this reasoning did not make sense to him, because he had asked Kosik on several occasions to go to Carter Controls with him since Kosik knew the company better, and was more familiar with its needs. (Id. at 75:15-76:8.) Canevari attested that he had previously explained to Kosik [*10]  that he had concerns about meeting Carter Controls on his own, but Kosik kept putting the meeting off. (Id. at 76:9-77:22.) Canevari asked Evanosky and Kosik for an opportunity to address their concerns and improve his performance, but Evanosky and Kosik declined. Canevari states that he was shocked at the decision, since he had not previously had any indication that his performance was unsatisfactory, and because his sales numbers were good, particularly in relation to those of the company's other sales agents. (Pl. SMF ¶¶ 78-95.)

III. LEGAL STANDARD
Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides as follows:
A party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense — or the part of each claim or defense — on which summary judgment is sought. The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court should state on the record the reasons for granting or denying the motion.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). For purposes of Rule 56, a fact is material if proof of its existence of nonexistence might affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable substantive law. Haybarger v. Laurence Cnty. Adult Prob. & Parole, 667 F.3d 408, 412 (3d Cir. 2012) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). For an issue to be genuine, "all that is required [*11]  is that sufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual dispute be shown to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth at trial." Id. (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248-49).
Accordingly, in support of a motion for summary judgment, the moving party must show that if the evidence of record were reduced to admissible evidence in court, it would be insufficient to allow the non-moving party to carry its burden of proof. See Celotex v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Provided the moving party has satisfied this burden, "its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007). Instead, if the moving party has carried its burden, the nonmoving party must then respond by identifying specific facts, supported by evidence, which show a genuine issue for trial, and may not rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings. See Marten v. Godwin, 499 F.3d 290, 295 (3d Cir. 2007); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (c).
In adjudicating the motion, the court must view the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the opposing party, Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255, and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, 1363 (3d Cir. 1992). Where the non-moving party's evidence contradicts the movant's, then the non-movant's must be taken as true. Id. Additionally, [*12]  the court is not to decide whether the evidence unquestionably favors one side or the other, or to make credibility determinations, but instead must decide whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented. Id. at 252; see also Big Apple BMW, 974 F.2d at 1363. In reaching this determination, the Third Circuit has instructed that:
To raise a genuine issue of material fact . . . the opponent need not match, item for item, each piece of evidence proffered by the movant. In practical terms, if the opponent has exceeded the "mere scintilla" threshold and has offered a genuine issue of material fact, then the court cannot credit the movant's version of events against the opponent, even if the quantity of the movant's evidence far outweighs that of its opponent. It thus remains the province of the factfinder to ascertain the believability and weight of the evidence.
Id. In contrast, "[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted); NAACP v. North Hudson Reg'l Fire & Rescue, 665 F.3d 464, 476 (3d Cir. 2011).

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Disability Discrimination

1. The ADA, ADAAA, Burden Shifting and the Prima Facie Standard.
The purpose of the ADA is [*13]  to "prevent employment discrimination of qualified individuals on account of their disability." Koller v. Riley Riper Hollin & Colagreco, 850 F. Supp. 2d 502, 512 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). The Act requires employers to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical and mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability, unless the employer demonstrates that such accommodations would impose an undue hardship in the operation of their business." Id. (quoting Fleck v. WILMAC, Corp., No. 10-5562, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54039, at *10 (E.D. Pa. May 19, 2011)).
In order to make out a prima facie claim for workplace discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he is (1) disabled within the meaning of the ADA, (2) is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations by the employer, and (3) has suffered an adverse employment decision as a result of the discrimination. Sulima v. Tobyhanna Army Depot, 602 F.3d 177, 185 (3d Cir. 2010); see also Stadtmiller v. UPMC Health Plan, Inc., 491 F. App'x 334, 336 (3d Cir. 2012); Gaul v. Lucent Techs., 134 F.3d 576, 580 (3d Cir. 1998).
If the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing under this three-part standard, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse employment action. Id. If a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is given, then the plaintiff must present evidence to demonstrate that the defendant's reasons were pretext for its unlawful action. Id. The [*14]  plaintiff may meet this burden by identifying evidence that allows a factfinder either to disbelieve the employer's articulated legitimate justification, or to conclude that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a "but for" cause of the employment action. Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir. 1994).
The ADA was substantially amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA"), Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (as codified in provisions of 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq.), which became effective as of January 1, 2009, and therefore the amendments to the ADA are applicable to this case. In passing the amendments to the legislation, "Congress has made clear that the question of whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis. Indeed, Congress has instructed that in construing the definition of 'disability' under the ADA, it shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals under the ADA, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the [ADA]." Rubano v. Farrell Area Sch. Dist., 991 F. Supp. 2d 678, 690 (W.D. Pa. 2014) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Congress's purpose in amending the ADA was to "reinstat[e] a broad scope of protection" under the ADA. Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 § 2(b). Under this statutory mandate, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") revised its implementing regulations to define disability "broadly [*15]  in favor of expansive coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.1(c)(4). Review of the definitions provided by the Act and its implementing regulations make clear the expansive reach of the statute's protections.
Under the ADAAA, to qualify as disabled, a plaintiff must prove one of the following: (1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; (2) a record of such impairment; or (3) being regarded as having such impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).
The ADA defines "disability", in pertinent part, as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). Regulations that have been promulgated by the EEOC define "physical impairment" to include "any physiological disorder, or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting [certain] body systems, such as neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, immune, circulatory, hemic, lymphatic, skin, and endocrine." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(h)(1) (emphasis added).
"Major life activities" include functions such as "caring for oneself, performing manual [*16]  tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, interacting with others, and working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i)(1)(i). In determining examples of major life activities, the regulations provide that the term "major" shall not be interpreted to create a "demanding standard" for disability. Id. § 1630.2(i)(2) (emphasis added).
With respect to major life activities, the regulations provide that the term "substantially limits" shall be defined broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to "the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA" and also is "not meant to be a demanding standard." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i). An impairment is considered a disability "if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population." Id. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). However, an impairment "need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting," Id., although "not every impairment will constitute a disability[.]" Id. The thrust of the ADAAA and its implementing regulations thus call for [*17]  broad coverage and consideration of an individual's own particular circumstances in determining whether that individual is suffers from a disability within the meaning of the Act.
An impairment that is episodic or even on that is in remission may still qualify as a disability so long as it "substantially limit[s] a major life activity when it is active." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(D); accord Britting v. Sec'y, Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 409 F. App'x 566, 568 (3d Cir. 2011); Pallatto v. Westmorland County Children's Bureau, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27008, at *29 (W.D. Pa. 2014). Likewise, a disability may continue even after a person has surgery or other mitigating treatment, provided the person continues to be substantially limited in a major life activity. See, e.g., Mengel v. Reading Eagle Co., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45300, 2013 WL 1285477, at *3-4 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 29, 2013) (plaintiff continued to suffer from problems with balance after undergoing surgery on a brain tumor); see also Lloyd v. Housing Auth. Of the City of Montgomery, 857 F. Supp. 2d 1252, 1263 (M.D. Ala. 2012) ("At bottom, the expanded definitions of 'disability' and 'major life activities' mean that treatable yet chronic conditions like hypertension and asthma render an affected person just as disabled as a wheelchair-bound paraplegic — if only for the purposes of disability law.").
The amendments to the ADA thus broadened substantially the definition of disability, and whereas prior to the amendments Third Circuit case law held that "permanent or long term impact, or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from impairment" were [*18]  relevant considerations, Emory v. AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, 401 F.3d 174, 179-80 (3d Cir. 2005), the updated EEOC regulations have been changed and now provide that the "effects of an impairment lasting or expected to last fewer than six months can be substantially limiting." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ix). Likewise, "an impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active." Id. § 1630.2(j)(1)(vii); see also Eastman v. Research Pharms., Inc.,, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107935, at *26-27, 2013 WL 3949236 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 1, 2013) (temporal duration of the plaintiff's back pain did not preclude a finding that plaintiff's back impairment "substantially limits" major life activities).

2. Canevari Has Adduced Evidence Sufficient to Show that He was Disabled at the Time He was Fired.
The parties in this case dispute whether Canevari was substantially limited or had a physical disability for purposes of the ADA. Whether an individual is substantially limited in performing a major life activity, including working, is generally a question of fact. See Williams v. Phila. Hous. Auth. Police Dep't, 380 F.3d 751, 763 (3d Cir. 2004). "Accordingly, on a motion for summary judgment, the court must determine whether the plaintiff adduced sufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could infer that plaintiff was substantially limited in his ability to perform a major life activity." Rocco v. Gordon Food Serv., 998 F. Supp. 2d 422, 426 (W.D. Pa. 2014).
A determination about whether the plaintiff was "disabled" [*19]  within the meaning of the ADAAA is dependent on whether the plaintiff was disabled at the time of the adverse employment decision — in this case, the date of Canevari's termination. See Rocco, 998 F. Supp. 2d at 426; Bush v. Donahoe, 964 F. Supp. 2d 401, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111681, 2013 WL 4045785, at *11 (W.D. Pa. 2013) ("[W]ith regard to the 'actual disability' prong, the test is whether, at the time of the adverse employment action, the limitation caused by the impairment was 'substantial.'"); Koller, 850 F. Supp. 2d at 513; Fleck, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54039, 2011 WL 1899198, at *5 ("The Court's relevant determination . . . is whether the plaintiff had a disability at the time of the adverse employment decision.").
In arguing that the plaintiff has not come forward with sufficient evidence to show that he was disabled at the time they fired him, the defendant has too narrowly construed the ambit of the ADA and its definitions regarding "disability" and "substantially limits" and "major life activities," which are summarized above. Instead, the defendant seems to argue that Canevari cannot be considered to have been disabled, and that it never considered Canevari to have a disability, because he remained capable of performing the essential functions of his job. Thus, the defendant explicitly argues that the plaintiff is not disabled because he does not have a disability "which effected his ability to perform [*20]  his job responsibilities." (Def. Br. at 6.) This crabbed definition is plainly out of step with the expansive definition of disability as provided by the ADAAA, and is erroneous as a matter of law.
The plaintiff emphasizes that under the ADA as amended, the protections of the Act are now substantially broader than they were previously, and he maintains that he has adduced more than sufficient evidence that would allow a jury to find that he suffers from a disability as defined under the ADAAA. In this regard, the plaintiff notes that he has suffered from Scheurmann's hypokyphosis since he was 12 years old. Mr. Canevari testified that this condition limits him in certain life activities, including standing, walking, bending, and sitting — all of which are activities that fall within the statutory definitions discussed above. (Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 46-54.) Indeed, the plaintiff has attested that the condition can be bad enough that it limits him to standing, sitting, or lying down for more than 15 minutes. (Id. at ¶ 47.) He stated that he can no longer golf, fish, or hunt because of his back condition. (Id.) He asserts that his sleep is affected, and that when he is forced to stand for long periods [*21]  of time, he endures back pain and shooting numbness in his legs and feet, which requires him to sit. (Id. at ¶¶48-49.)
The plaintiff has also offered medical record evidence to substantiate his own personal attestations regarding his back condition and its affects upon him. (Id. at ¶¶ 55-63 and Ex. F.) These records would show that as far back as 2007, Canevari was diagnosed with "a very good history or Scheuerman's kyphosis." (Id. ¶ 55 and Ex. F at P13.) The medical records also support his claims regarding the limiting effects of this condition, as they indicate that "for years" the condition has limited in sitting, bending, standing, and walking. (Id. ¶¶ 56-57 and Ex. F at P13.) A doctor diagnosed Canevari with "a slight dextroscoliosis of cervical spine." (Id. ¶ 58 and Ex. F at P75-76.) Other records note the following medical information that substantiates Canevari's assertions regarding his alleged disability:
• In January 2015, Medical Associates of Northeastern Pennsylvania provided treatment for "severe lower back pain" that "has been going on for years." (Id. ¶ 59 and Ex. F at P57.)
• On February 11, 2015, medical notes indicate the kyphosis diagnosis and observed "mild degenerative [*22]  changes in the lower thoracic spine." (Id. ¶ 61 and Ex. F at P77.)
• In July 2015, Dr. Henderson with Scranton Orthopedic Specialists treated the plaintiff, and records note that the plaintiff's back condition gives him trouble with "standing or walking." (Id. ¶ 60 and Ex. F. at P37.)
• These records indicate a worsening of the condition, with Dr. Henderson stating that "thoracic and lumbar MRI performance in June 2015 reveals increased thoracic kyphosis" and that an MRI revealed "a small central and somewhat left-sided disc bulge at L4-5 with mild foraminal stenosis." (Id. ¶ 62 and Ex. F at P37.)
• In October 2015, medical records noted a "known history of disc disease." (Id. ¶ 63 and Ex. F. at P65.)2
The defendant largely ignores this medical evidence, focused instead on its argument that because Mr. Canevari could perform the functions of his job he was not suffering from a disability. These records and the plaintiff's own attestations regarding his medical condition and its substantially limiting effects on his activities of daily living provide sufficient evidence to support the plaintiff's contention that he suffered from a physically disabling condition, and thus it is recommended [*23]  that the Court decline to embrace the defendant's unsupported assertions to the contrary.

3. Mr. Canevari was Qualified to Perform the Functions of His Job and Suffered an Adverse Employment Decision.
The next two issues for purposes of establishing a prima facie case do not appear to be disputed, as the defendant has not argued that Canevari was not qualified to perform the functions of his job, and that he was fired. It is thus recommended that the Court find that the plaintiff has satisfied these elements for purposes of considering the defendant's motion for summary judgment.

4. There is Evidence in the Record to Support the Plaintiff's Assertion that the Defendant Perceived or Regarded Him as Disabled and Terminated Him Based Upon That Determination.
The parties also disagree about whether the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence that would permit a factfinder to conclude that the defendant perceived or regarded the plaintiff as being disabled, and that it terminated his employment based upon that perception. Although this is a closer issue, recognizing that it is not the province of the court to weigh evidence, or assess credibility, when passing upon a motion for summary [*24]  judgment, we believe that the record contains evidence that would support this assertion, focusing particularly on comments that Evanosky allegedly made to the plaintiff demonstrating an awareness of the plaintiff's back condition, comments that could be considered dismissive of this medical condition, the plaintiff's notification of an April medical appointment, and the relatively close temporal proximity between this evidence and the time that the plaintiff was fired, which seems to have occurred the day after this medical appointment.
A plaintiff who claims that his employer regarded him as disabled must show that the employer regarded him as having a "substantially limiting impairment," which means an impairment that would preclude him from a range of jobs or that substantially limit the plaintiff from one or more major life activities. Sutton v. United Airlines, 527 U.S. 471, 482, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A), (C). "[T]he mere fact that an employer is aware of an employee's impairment is insufficient to demonstrate . . . that the employer regarded the employee as disabled." Lewis v. Genesis Healthcare Corp., 826 F. Supp. 2d 765, 775 (E.D. Pa. 2011) (quoting Kelly v. Drexel Univ., 94 F.3d 102, 109 (3d Cir. 1996)); Warshaw v. Concentra Health Servs., 719 F. Supp. 2d 484, 496 (E.D. Pa. 2010) ("Defendants correctly respond that . . . mere knowledge of plaintiff's [impairment] is insufficient to know that plaintiff was regarded as disabled."). Furthermore, [*25]  despite liberalizing the ADA and expanding its scope through the changes enacted as part of the ADAAA, the law nevertheless provides that causation is "an integral part of the threshold finding that a plaintiff is regarded as having a disability." Baughman v. Cheung Enters., LLC, No. 13-1511, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125799, 2014 WL 4437545, at *12 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 9, 2014); see also Tirk v. DuBrook, Inc., Civ. A. No. 2:14-889, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13666, 2016 WL 427738 (W.D. Pa. Feb. 4, 2016).
Accordingly, a plaintiff must do more than show mere knowledge of an impairment, but must instead show that his disability, or perceived disability, was a "determinative factor in [defendant's] decision to terminate his employment." Decker v. Alliant Techs., LLC, 871 F. Supp. 2d 413, 428 (E.D. Pa. 2012); see also Mengel v. Reading Eagle Co., No. 11-6151, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45300, 2013 WL 1285477, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 29, 2013) ("At the summary judgment stage, an ADA plaintiff must provide evidence that supports a logical inference of causation between the alleged disability and the adverse employment action.").
Temporal proximity, whether standing alone or in conjunction with other theories of discriminatory motive, may be sufficient to raise an inference of "regarded as" disability discrimination, and for a plaintiff's ADA discrimination claims to survive summary judgment. See, e.g., Tirk, Civ. A. No. 2:14-889, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13666, at *10, 2016 WL 427738 (W.D. Pa. Feb. 4, 2016) (citing Warshaw, 719 F. Supp. 2d at 496). At the same time, there is no bright-line rule in every case as to "what temporal gap is sufficiently narrow to create such an inference." Id.; [*26]  see also Hibbard v. Penn-Trafford Sch. Dist., No. 13-622, 2014 U.S. Dist. Lexis 20237, 2013 WL 640253, at *18 (W.D. Pa. Feb. 19, 2014) (observing that the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has not specified a strict formula for what is considered to be too long of a gap between protected activity and adverse action). Therefore, "the weight of temporal evidence is context-specific and 'must be considered with a careful eye to the specific facts and circumstances encountered.'" Proudfoot v. Arnold Logistics, LLC, 59 F. Supp. 3d 697, 708 (M.D. Pa. 2014) (quoting Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., 206 F.3d 271, 279 (3d Cir. 2000).
Where courts have relied on temporal proximity to find a plaintiff has satisfied his burden of making a prima facie showing of discrimination, they have "typically required an extremely short time period or the existence of additional circumstantial facts to support causation." Tirk, Civ. A. No. 2:14-889, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13666, at *12, 2016 WL 427738 (W.D. Pa. Feb. 4, 2016); see also Booze v. Wetzel, No. 13-2139, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118367, 2015 WL 5173937, at *15 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 2, 2015) (in retaliation cases, noting that the Third Circuit's precedents "suggests that the temporal proximity must be measured in days, rather than weeks or months, to suggest causation where employer terminated plaintiff within a week of learning about her bipolar disorder); LaGatta v. Pa. Cyber Charter Sch., 726 F. Supp. 2d 578, 587-88 (W.D. Pa. 2010) (evidence of causation demonstrated where employer terminated plaintiff within one week of learning about her bipolar disorder); Bullock v. Balis & Co., No. 99-748, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18207, 2000 WL 1858719, at *7 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 19, 2000) (termination one week after plaintiff's attention deficit disorder was revealed suggestive of causation).
Where more [*27]  than a few short days have elapsed, courts will sometimes consider the timing together with other corroborative facts to find that a plaintiff has developed sufficient probative evidence to allow an inference of causation. See, e.g., Stewart v. Bally Total Fitness, No. 99-3555, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10047, 2000 WL 1006936, at *5 (E.D. Pa. July 20, 2000) (fact of plaintiff's demotion one month after suffering nervous breakdown, combined with evidence that the plaintiff's co-workers taunted him based on a perceived disability, sufficiently suggestive of discrimination). Facts that may provide corroboration in conjunction with suggestive temporal proximity include "evidence of a pattern of antagonism or retaliatory motive during the intervening period" or evidence that the employer provided "inconsistent reasons for the adverse employment action." Tirk, Civ. A. No. 2:14-889, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13666, at *12, 2016 WL 427738 (W.D. Pa. Feb. 4, 2016) (quoting Bush, 964 F. Supp. 2d at 425); see also Kahan v. Slippery Rock Univ. of Pa., 50 F. Supp. 3d 667, 701 (W.D. Pa. 2014)(citing Farrell, 206 F.3d at 280) (same).
The defendant points out that the record is barren of evidence to show that the plaintiff ever notified Rich Kosik about his back problems, and Kosik has attested that he was never aware of the plaintiff's back condition prior to his termination. Indeed, Kosik testified that far from perceiving the plaintiff as having a potentially disabling condition, he understood the plaintiff [*28]  to be fit and able and frequently engaged in lifting heavy objects and working on in-home construction projects. We agree that if this case focused exclusively on what Kosik knew or perceived regarding the plaintiff's back condition, there may be insufficient evidence on this score. But the plaintiff relies instead on what he had reported to Keith Evanosky, who is the person who recommended his termination. This evidence is more supportive of the plaintiff's contention regarding the defendant's perception of his back condition as disabling, and the temporal relationship between comments that Evanosky allegedly made and the defendant's decision to terminate Canevari's employment.
Canevari agrees that prior to the Atlanta trade show from March 16-20, 2014, the defendant had no reason to know of his allegedly disabling back condition. However, he contends that during that convention, which he attended with Evanosky, the defendant did have reason to know about it. Canevari has attested that during the trade show he asked Evanosky if he could sit down because he was having issues with his back, to which Evanosky allegedly replied, "Are you crazy?" (Canevari Dep. at 55:18-56:1.) The plaintiff [*29]  testified that during this same conversation he told Evanosky that his back was bothering him, his leg had gone numb, his hand was tingling, and he needed to sit down. (Id. at 56:2-4; 57:14-58:12.) Instead of acceding to this request, Evanosky allegedly replied, "Do you know how much money we spent on this? If you value your job, keep talking to customers. You can sit down tonight." (Id. at 56:5-8; 57:14-58:12.) Canevari claims that he made requests for accommodation to Evanosky three or four times during the trade show. (Id. at 56:9-12.) According to the plaintiff, Evanosky denied these requests. (Id. at 56:18-21.) Canevari says that he could have sat in nearby chairs but elected to remain standing because he was concerned about losing his job based on what Evanosky said to him. (Id. at 56:23-57:9.) According to Canevari, he also experienced obvious pain and limitations on the trip home, as he had to stand on the train and he told Evanosky that his leg had gone numb on the train ride. (Id. at 60:22-61:7; see also Evanosky Dep. at 26:9-27:1.)
Canevari reportedly explained to Evanosky that his back was really bothering him and that one day he might need to have surgery to correct the [*30]  problem. (Canevari Dep. at 61:8-14.) According to Canevari, Evanosky responded by threatening the plaintiff, allegedly saying, "I won't keep you around for [back surgery]." (Id. at 61:8-17.) For his part, Evanosky recalls the plaintiff telling him that he had a back condition similar to scoliosis that caused him to be unable to play golf any longer, and he remembered that he and Canevari discussed the potential for surgery while the two were at the airport coming home from the trade show. (Evanosky Dep. at 23:19-25-8.)
Approximately one week after returning home, the plaintiff informed Itoh Denki — likely Keith Evanosky specifically — that he had a doctor's appointment scheduled relating to the issues he had been experiencing with his back, and which he had specifically discussed with Evanosky. (Canevari Dep. at 64:9-65:23.) Canevari attested that he told Evanosky verbally about the appointment and the reason for it, and he followed up with an email on April 5, 2014, confirming the appointment would be on Monday, April 7, 2014. (Id. at 66:6-67:5, 67:22-68:2.) Canevari attested that this is the only time he informed his employer about a doctor's appointment. (Id. at 68:10-21.) Record [*31]  evidence substantiates the medical appointment that Canevari had on April 7. (Doc. 42-1, Ex. F at P55.) Evanosky acknowledged that Canevari requested time off from work to attend a doctor's appointment on that day. (Evanosky Dep. at 55:2-9.)
The day after the doctor's appointment, Rich Kosik and Keith Evanosky informed Canevari that they were terminating his employment effective April 8, 2014. (Kosik Dep. at 138:2-5.)
The evidence in this case, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, thus reveals that within a relatively short time frame, the plaintiff made his employer aware that a long-term back condition had recently worsened, and he explained to his supervisor some of the activities of daily living that were limited as a result; his employer reacted negatively to that news, and expressly declined his request for modest accommodations, and threatened his employment if he pursued surgery; and terminated his employment one day after he went to a scheduled doctor's appointment to seek medical treatment for the back pain he had been experiencing. The plaintiff will, of course, have the burden of persuading a jury as to these factual assertions, but he has presented evidence [*32]  that would allow a jury to do so, and the combination of the foregoing evidence, and the compressed schedule between the defendant becoming aware of the condition and terminating the plaintiff's employment, is sufficient to withstand the defendant's motion with respect to this aspect of the plaintiff's claims.

5. The Plaintiff Has Presented Evidence to Show that the Defendant's Stated Reasons for Terminating His Employment were Prextextual.
In this case, the defendant argues that even if the Court finds that the plaintiff has presented a prima facie case of disability discrimination, it is still entitled to summary judgment because it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for firing the plaintiff, as it concluded that the plaintiff lacked fundamental skills as a salesman, which was most dramatically demonstrated by his failure to pay any meaningful calls on one of the company's most important customers in his sales territory.
With the defendant having come forward with a legitimate, nondiscriminatory justification for its action, the burden returns to the plaintiff to point to some evidence, direct or circumstantial, from which a jury could reasonably either (1) disbelieve the employer's [*33]  articulated legitimate reasons for firing him, or (2) believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative factor of the employer's action. See Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir. 1994); see also Watson v. Se. Pa. Trans. Auth., 207 F.3d 207, 214-15 (3d Cir. 2000) (holding that the "but-for" test applies to disability discrimination claims). One way in which the plaintiff can meet this burden is to show that the defendant's proffered reasons for the adverse employment action are contradicted in the record, or are inconsistent. See Zelinski v. Pa. State Police, 108 F. App'x 700, 707 (3d Cir. 2004). In order discredit the stated justification in this way, the plaintiff "must demonstrate such 'weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reason for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence, and hence infer that the employer did not act of the asserted non-discriminatory reasons." Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 765; see also Tomasso v. Boeing Co., 445 F.3d 702, 707 (3d Cir. 2006) (observing that "the rejection of some explanations may so undermine the employer's credibility as to enable a rational factfinder to disbelieve the remaining rationales, even where the employee fails to produce evidence particular to those rationales."). In order to demonstrate pretext, a plaintiff may [*34]  also point to evidence to cast doubt on the defendant's credibility, the timing of his dismissal, and to evidence of disparate treatment. Simpson v Kay Jewelers, 142 F.3d 639, 644-45 (3d Cir. 1998); Josey v. John R. Hollingsworth Corp., 996 F.2d 632, 638-39 (3d Cir. 1993; see also Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 765.
In this case the plaintiff first points to evidence of unusually close temporal proximity between his doctor's appointment and the date he was fired in order to carry his burden of proof on the question of pretext. In support of this argument, the plaintiff relies on cases showing that where there is especially close proximity between protected activity and an adverse employment action, courts will sometimes find that proximity alone is sufficient to create a disputed issue of fact regarding the defendant's proffered legitimate reason. See, e.g., Jalil v. Avdel Corp., 873 F.2d 701, 708 (3d Cir. 1989) (finding evidence of causation based on the fact that only two days separated the plaintiff's protected activity and the defendant's alleged retaliation); Waters v. Genesis Health Ventures, Inc., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25604 (E.D. Pa. 2004) (inference of causation where four days passed between protected activity and alleged retaliation). The plaintiff notes that here, at most two weeks passed between the defendant learning of the plaintiff's disabling condition and its decision to fire him, which took place just one day after he was seen by a doctor.
The plaintiff also urges [*35]  the Court to consider this brief temporal gap together with evidence that he argues suggests the defendant had demonstrated antagonism when it learned of the plaintiff's back problems. Canevari points to his own testimony to show that the Evanosky was both dismissive of his asserted medical issues, possibly threatened his employment if he underwent an operation, and denied his requests for modest accommodations at the trade show, shortly before the plaintiff was fired.
In addition to temporal proximity and evidence of antagonism, the plaintiff has also pointed to evidence to suggest that he was treated in a disparate manner from other Itoh Denki salespeople — evidence that the plaintiff argues is most commonly relied upon to prove pretext. See Iadimarco v. Runyon, 190 F.3d 151, 162 (3d Cir. 1999). Although the defendant sharply disputes this argument, asserting generally that every one of its sales territories is unique (and, presumably, could thus never be used as comparator evidence), the plaintiff notes that sales in his Northeastern region increased substantially more than other company sales representatives, and he notes that he made more sales calls than any other sales representative. The plaintiff thus argues that the defendant's [*36]  assertion that it fired him for subpar performance in his sales territory is belied by other evidence, and should be sufficient to cast doubt on the defendant's proffered legitimate reason for terminating him.
Finally, the plaintiff points to other evidence in the record that he argues combines with the foregoing arguments to show pretext that would allow a jury to disbelieve the defendant. Here, the plaintiff notes that he had been employed at Itoh Denki for 10 months and had not had any disciplinary action taken against him. He argues that from June 2013 through March 2014, he furnished Rich Kosik with daily reports regarding the customers he had seen, and not once did Kosik ever question his work or the customers that he was visiting. He also points to evidence that Kosik had instructed him that his priority was to find new Itoh Denki customers rather than focusing his efforts on existing accounts, and that Rich Kosik expressly praised his efforts at business development when Keith Evanosky was hired. (Pl. SMF ¶¶ 13-17, 101-102.)
Although Itoh Denki is adamant that it had legitimate and reasonable reasons for firing the plaintiff, at this stage where we are constrained to consider [*37]  the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, the plaintiff has carried his burden of coming forward with a variety of evidence that when looked at singly, and especially in combination, could allow a factfinder to disbelieve the defendant regarding its reasons for firing Canaveri, or to believe that it is more likely than not that the decision was motivated by the discovery of the plaintiff's allegedly disabling medical condition. The record on these points is disputed and in conflict, and is inappropriate for summary judgment.
For all of the foregoing reasons, it will be recommended that the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the plaintiff's claims of disability discrimination be denied.

B. Retaliation
The plaintiff has also brought a claim alleging that the defendant retaliated against him for seeking an accommodation for his disability after his back pain worsened in March 2014. The ADA prohibits employers from retaliating against their employees for requesting accommodations for physical or mental disabilities. Sulima v. Tobyhanna Army Depot, 602 F.3d 177, 188 (3d Cir. 2010); Shellenberger v. Summit Bancorp, Inc., 318 F.3d 183, 191 (3d Cir. 2003).
To establish a prima facie case of unlawful retaliation in violation of the ADA, a plaintiff must show that he engaged in protected activity, that he [*38]  suffered adverse action either after or contemporaneous with the protected activity, and that there was a causal connection between the employee's protected activity and the employer's adverse action. See Krouse v. Am. Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 500 (3d Cir. 1997); Treaster v. Conestoga Wood Specialties, Corp., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63257, at *98, 2010 WL 2606479 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 29, 2010).

1. The Plaintiff Has Presented Evidence of Protected Activity.
An employee engages in protected activity when he requests a reasonable accommodation for his disability under both the ADA and the PHRA. Shellenberger, 318 F.3d at 191 ("The right to request an accommodation in good faith is no less a guarantee under the ADA than the right to file a complaint with the EEOC . . . .").
Canevari asserts that while at the trade show with Evanosky, he requested permission to sit on a number of occasions because of his back condition, which was subsequently explained to Evanosky in greater detail. Canevari also notes that he later told Evanosky that he had made a doctor's appointment specifically regarding the back issue, and that he confirmed this appointment through an email to Evanosky. The defendant argues that there is "no evidence that plaintiff advised defendant of the purpose for his doctor's appointment." (Def. Br. at 16.) This assertion is belied by review of the plaintiff's actual deposition testimony, where [*39]  he stated that he told Evanosky verbally that he had a doctor's appointment because he was experiencing severe back pain. (Canaveri Dep. at 64-66.) The defendant's summary characterization of this evidence is inaccurate and somewhat misleading. Although the plaintiff's deposition testimony does not go on at length regarding his conversation with Evanosky it is clear that he testified in response to multiple questions attempting to discredit him that he did, in fact, tell Evanosky about the reason for his medical appointment.3

2. The Plaintiff Has Adduced Evidence to Show a Causal Link Between his Protected Activity and His Termination
There is no dispute that the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action when he was fired, but the defendant contends that he has not demonstrated any connection between his limited requests for accommodation and the defendant's subsequent decision to fire him.
The plaintiff, for his part, argues that he has direct evidence to support a causal connection, pointing to his own testimony that when he approached Evanosky for modest accommodations at the trade show Evanosky responded in a manner that seemed to threaten his employment. Perhaps more pointedly, [*40]  the plaintiff testified that when he told Evanosky he might need to have surgery on his back, Evanosky allegedly told him "I won't keep you around for [back surgery]." (Canaveri Dep. at 61:8-17.) The plaintiff then told Evanosky he had made a doctor's appointment regarding the back pain, which he attended on April 7, and he was fired the following day, which the plaintiff again notes exhibits a very close temporal proximity between his discussions with Evanosky, his limited requests for accommodation, and the company's decision to fire him.
In short, the parties' disagreements regarding the probative value of this evidence, and about the defendant's asserted legitimate reasons for firing Canaveri, and whether these reasons are mere pretext for an unlawful motivation, essentially parallel the parties' arguments regarding the plaintiff's discrimination claim. Like those claims, it is submitted that the evidence concerning the plaintiff's retaliation claim is in dispute, and therefore is not appropriate for resolution on a motion for summary judgment.

C. Failure to Accommodate
Finally, the plaintiff has claimed that the defendant violated the ADA and PHRA by failing to accommodate him by [*41]  refusing to allow him to sit down during the trade show in Atlanta. The defendant argues that when this asserted request for accommodation was made, it was not on any notice that Canaveri had any disability, and thus this claim fails as a matter of law. We agree that as a standalone claim, it fails.
Case law from within the Third Circuit suggests that claims of ADA discrimination and failure to accommodate may often properly be consolidated, since a failure-to-accommodate claim is not so much a standalone claim as it is a theory that can in some cases support a discrimination claim. Solomon v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., 882 F. Supp. 2d 766, 776 (E.D. Pa. 2012). As one district court explained:
Though Solomon advances her ADA claims for failure to accommodate under two distinct counts, caselaw from our Court of Appeals suggests that these claims may be consolidated. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a) provides that "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." Our Court of Appeals has explained, quoting § 12112(b)(5)(A), that "[a]n employer discriminates against a qualified individual [*42]  when it does 'not mak[e] reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of the individual unless the [employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the [employer]."' Gaul v. Lucent Techs., 134 F.3d 576, 579 (3d Cir. 1998) (brackets in original). See also Colwell v. Rite Aid Corp., 602 F.3d 495, 504-05 (3d Cir. 2010) (noting that "[u]nder the ADA, an employer discriminates against an employee by not making reasonable accommodations" under certain circumstances) (internal quotation marks omitted); Hohider v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 574 F.3d 169, 186 (3d Cir. 2009) (describing elements a plaintiff must prove "for a covered entity to be found liable for discrimination on the basis of failure to accommodate"); Pagonakis v. Express LLC, 315 Fed. Appx. 425, 430 n. 4 (3d Cir. 2009) ("[Plaintiff's] ADA discrimination claim may nonetheless proceed on her failure to accommodate theory.").
As this jurisprudence demonstrates, a claim that an employer failed to accommodate an employee's disability is best viewed not as an independent claim under the ADA, but as a theory that may support a discrimination claim, with disparate treatment representing the other possible theory.
Id. at 776-77.
We find this reasoning persuasive, and especially apt in this particular case. At the outset, we note that were the plaintiff predicating his discrimination claim entirely on the alleged failure [*43]  of Itoh Denki to accommodate his requested accommodation, the claim would be problematic because the record does not contain evidence that would show that at the time Canaveri asked for the opportunity to sit down — the only accommodation he is claiming here — that Evanosky or anyone else at Itoh Denki knew, or had reason to know, that the plaintiff was suffering from a physical disability. Instead, it appears only that the plaintiff told Evanosky that his back was giving him trouble and he asked to sit down. Thus, even at the time that the plaintiff was asking for what he describes as an accommodation, Evanosky had no reason to believe or know that the plaintiff had a disability that might require accommodation in the first place.
In the absence of such evidence, we have difficulty perceiving how Evanosky alleged refusal to allow Canaveri to sit or take breaks at a trade show where they were meeting with clients and potential customers could amount to a failure to accommodate him because of his disability. Case law in this field teaches that for an employer to be liable for failing to accede to a requested accommodation, the employer needed to be on notice of both the fact that an [*44]  employee had a disability, and that the employee had requested accommodation. See, e.g., Drozdowski v. Northland Lincoln Mercury, 321 F. App'x 181, 185 (3d Cir. 2009) ("What matters under the ADA are not formalisms about the manner of the request, but whether the employee . . . provides the employer with enough information that, under the circumstances, the employer can fairly be said to know of both the disability and desire for accommodation.")). Here, we do not read the record to include sufficient evidence that would permit a jury to conclude that Itoh Denki was aware of a disabling condition at the time Evanosky denied the plaintiff's request to sit down at a trade show.
Accordingly, to the extent the plaintiff is attempting to prosecute a standalone claim for failure to accommodate, it will be recommended that that aspect of the defendant's motion be granted. However, we submit that the plaintiff may still be able to present this proof as part of his more broadly encompassing ADA discrimination claim.

V. RECOMMENDATION
For the foregoing reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that the defendant's motion for summary judgment be DENIED with respect to the plaintiff's claims for discrimination and retaliation under the ADA and PHRA. It is further RECOMMENDED that the defendant's [*45]  motion for summary judgment be GRANTED with respect to the plaintiff's standalone failure-to-accommodate claim.
The parties are further placed on notice that pursuant to Local Rule 72.3:
Any party may object to a magistrate judge's proposed findings, recommendations or report addressing a motion or matter described in 28 U.S.C. § 636 (b)(1)(B) or making a recommendation for the disposition of a prisoner case or a habeas corpus petition within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy thereof. Such party shall file with the clerk of court, and serve on the magistrate judge and all parties, written objections which shall specifically identify the portions of the proposed findings, recommendations or report to which objection is made and the basis for such objections. The briefing requirements set forth in Local Rule 72.2 shall apply. A judge shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made and may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge. The judge, however, need conduct a new hearing only in his or her discretion or where required by law, and may consider the record developed [*46]  before the magistrate judge, making his or her own determination on the basis of that record. The judge may also receive further evidence, recall witnesses or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.
