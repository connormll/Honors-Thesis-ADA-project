Opinion


ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Before the Court is Defendant Stout Risius Ross, Inc.'s ("SRR") Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the alternative, Partial Summary Judgment ("Motion"). Dkt. No. 20. Plaintiff Sidney Blum ("Plaintiff") filed an opposition and SRR filed a reply. Dkt. Nos. 32, 34. The Court heard oral argument on August 18, 2017. Dkt. No. 43. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART the Motion.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff alleges that SRR, his former employer, terminated his employment for two impermissible reasons: (1) his cancer-related medical condition and resulting disability, and (2) his objection to SRR's allegedly unlawful expense reimbursement policy for employee cell phone use. Dkt. No. 1-1, Complaint ("Compl.") ¶¶ 34-56.
Based on these [*2]  allegations, Plaintiff asserts the following claims: (1) medical condition discrimination in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (the "FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a); (2) disability discrimination in violation of the FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a); (3) failure to effect reasonable accommodation and failure to engage in the interactive process to effect reasonable accommodation in violation of the FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12940(m) and (n); and (4) wrongful termination in violation of public policy.
SRR moves for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is proper where the pleadings, discovery, and affidavits show that there is "no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The Court must view the evidence and the inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and the moving party bears the initial burden to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact for trial. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 251-52, 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). However, once the moving party has met its initial burden, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to show a genuine issue for trial by establishing that the fact in contention is material (i.e. affecting the outcome of the suit under [*3]  the governing law) and the dispute is genuine (i.e. the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party). Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 251-52; Owens v. Local No. 169, Assoc. of W. Pulp and Paper Workers, 971 F.2d 347, 355 (9th Cir. 1987).
When the non-moving party bears the burden of proof at trial, the moving party may meet its initial burden to show the absence of a genuine issue of fact for trial either by presenting evidence that negates an essential element of the non-moving party's claim or by pointing out there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-25. The non-moving party must make an affirmative showing on all matters placed at issue by the motion where it has the burden of proof at trial. Id.; see also Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250-52.

III. UNDISPUTED FACTS
Plaintiff is a Forensic Certified Public Accountant, working as an internal auditor, royalty auditor, and expert witness regarding forensic accounting issues. Compl. ¶ 6. SRR is a corporation engaged in the business of forensic accounting, valuation, investment banking, and litigation support. Compl. ¶ 3. On December 8, 2014, SRR hired Plaintiff as a Managing Director for its Dispute Advisory & Forensic Services Group in Los Angeles at an annual salary of $250,000. Dkt. No. 33, Pl.'s Statement of Disputed Issues [*4]  in Response to Def. SRR's Statement of Undisputed Facts ("Pl.'s Resp. SUF") 1. Before Plaintiff commenced his employment with SRR, Michele Riley, Plaintiff's immediate supervisor, advised him that he was expected to generate $1 million in revenue in 2015 and $1.5 million in revenue in 2016. Dkt. No. 30, Declaration of Michele Riley ("Riley Decl.") 3.
On May 5, 2015, Plaintiff informed Riley that he might need to undergo a round of thyroid radiation in June, which would require him to work from home for two weeks after the treatment. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 3. Riley had no objection to this request. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 4. In late September 2015, Plaintiff informed SRR that he had an aggressive form of thyroid cancer and would need to undergo treatment, but that he planned to continue working. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 6. SRR granted Plaintiff's request to go on "short-term disability," which permitted him to "work reduced hours at his discretion." Pl.'s Resp. SUF 7; Dkt. No. 29, Declaration of Christine Jaroszewicz ("Jaroszewics Decl.") ¶ 4; Compl. ¶ 9. From late September until February 9, 2016, Plaintiff worked approximately 20 hours per week. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 8.
Plaintiff began receiving short-term disability [*5]  benefits from SRR in October 2015. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 10; Jaroszewicz Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. 7. Under the terms of SRR's benefits plan for 2015, Plaintiff was entitled to 100% of his weekly base salary until early November 2015. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 15. However, SRR was in the process of changing its benefits plan for 2016 to provide 100% of an employee's base salary through the 90th day of an employee's short-term disability. Jaroszewicz Decl. ¶ 14. At Plaintiff's request, SRR extended this more favorable coverage to him in 2015, enabling him to receive 100% of his weekly salary until December 21, 2015. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 16; Jaroszewicz Decl. ¶ 14.
In early October 2015, Plaintiff inquired with SRR as to whether he should apply for California's state disability insurance benefits. Jaroszewicz Decl. ¶ 8. SRR informed Plaintiff that he should. Jaroszewicz Decl. ¶ 10. Shortly thereafter, SRR received the "Notice to Employer of Disability Insurance Claim Filed" form from the California Employment Development Department ("EDD"), filled it out, and submitted it to the EDD. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 14.
On October 2, 2015, Riley sent Plaintiff a draft of his performance review, highlighting his failure to meet his annual [*6]  target revenue goal of $1 million. Riley Decl. ¶ 6. Plaintiff had generated less than $600,000 in revenue at the time of the performance review. Riley Decl. ¶ 6. Later that day, Plaintiff e-mailed Riley, stating that his "sales goal should be prorated." Pl.'s Resp. SUF 11. Prorating his sales goals would have allowed Plaintiff to receive a prorated annual bonus. Dkt. No. 32-1, Declaration of Sidley Blum ("Blum Decl.") ¶¶ 12-13. During a telephone call to discuss Plaintiff's draft performance review, Riley informed Plaintiff that SRR would not prorate his revenue requirements for 2015. Riley Decl. ¶ 7.
On November 10, 2015, SRR informed Plaintiff that if he were to receive any disability benefits from the State of California for the period ending on December 21, 2015, he would be required to reimburse that amount to SRR. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 17. As of November 10, 2015, SRR had not received any written response from the EDD on whether Plaintiff's claim for disability benefits had been approved or whether he was being paid disability benefits. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 18.
On December 8, 2015, Plaintiff became eligible for leave under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), having completed his first [*7]  full year of employment with SRR. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 20. After December 21, 2015, therefore, SRR paid Plaintiff his full regular wages of $20,833.33 per month while he remained on intermittent FMLA leave until February 9, 2016. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 21. Plaintiff resumed working full-time shortly after February 9, 2016. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 25.
On January 18, 2016, Christine Jaroszewicz, SRR's human resources manager, e-mailed Plaintiff and asked the following two questions:
Time Entries: I noticed that you have been classifying the time that you haven't been working as DTO. This time should be classified as FMLA. Any time that you have entered as DTO with LTD as the description will be changed to FMLA in Elite. Further, Carrie mentioned that you indicated you were working more hours than you were entering into Elite. If this is accurate, please let me know immediately so that we can make sure we are recording your time accurately.
State of California Disability: While on short-term disability with SRR (in which we paid you 100% of your wages), did you receive short-term disability benefits from the state of California?
Pl.'s Resp. SUF 22; Jaroszewicz Decl. ¶ 19, Ex. 6. Plaintiff responded, "OK, I will [*8]  record as FMLA and no." Pl.'s Resp. SUF 23. Jaroszewicz understood Plaintiff's response to mean that he had not received any short-term disability benefits from California during his leave that began in September 2015. Jaroszewicz Decl. ¶ 20. On the same day that Plaintiff responded to Jaroszewicz's questions, Plaintiff sent a follow-up e-mail to Jaroszewicz, stating, "Didn't finish my prior response. No, I don't have the records of actual hours worked, but have recorded all chargeable time." Pl.'s Resp. SUF 24; Blum Decl. ¶ 42, Ex. 18.
On May 4, 2016, Plaintiff sought a second leave of absence, informing Riley that he would need to take time off from May 17 to May 27 for surgery. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 27. SRR granted Plaintiff's request. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 28. On May 26, 2016, Plaintiff informed Riley that he had not stopped working despite his surgery, but that he was on "brain altering medication" and therefore was not ready for "billable" work. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 30. That same day, Riley informed Plaintiff of her preference that he not work while on "brain altering medication." Pl.'s Resp. SUF 31. On June 1, 2016, Jaroszewicz instructed Plaintiff not to perform any work until he could provide [*9]  medical documentation that he was able to perform his duties. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 32. On or around June 8, 2016, SRR received an FMLA medical certification from Plaintiff's doctor, stating that Plaintiff might require a "part-time or reduced work schedule" from May 17, 2016 to August 30, 2016, depending on Plaintiff's blood test results. Jeroszewicz Decl. ¶ 28, Ex. 10. In an "Attending Physician Statement," Plaintiff's doctor noted that Plaintiff should not work overtime or on weekends. Blum Decl. ¶ 62, Ex. 35. During this period, SRR paid Plaintiff the equivalent of his full regular salary. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 28.
In connection with his second leave, Plaintiff again applied for state disability benefits. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 29. During a call with the EDD regarding his second application for state disability benefits, Plaintiff informed the EDD that, during his first leave, SRR had paid him an amount equal to his base pay less his state disability benefits. Opp'n 16. The EDD employee asked Plaintiff whether he was certain that SRR had reduced his pay by the state disability benefits that he received in 2015, and Plaintiff responded that he had never checked. Blum Decl. ¶ 64. Plaintiff claims that [*10]  following the call with the EDD, he examined his state disability benefits receipts and discovered that SRR had failed to reduce his 2015 pay by the amount that he received in state disability benefits. Opp'n 16. He then contacted the EDD to inform them that he had been overpaid. Opp'n 16. The EDD responded that Plaintiff could return the overpayment to the EDD or SRR, or could "appeal the overpayment." Opp'n 16. Plaintiff decided to appeal the overpayment. Blum Decl. ¶ 65. Thereafter, the EDD contacted SRR to discuss Plaintiff's receipt of state disability benefits during his first leave. Pl.'s Resp. SUF ¶¶ 36-37.
After Jaroszewics was informed by the EDD that Plaintiff had received state disability benefits in 2015, she began to doubt Plaintiff's integrity. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 38. She had believed, based on Plaintiff's response to her previous inquiry about whether he had received state disability benefits, that Plaintiff had not received any disability benefits from the State of California. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 38. On June 13, 2016, Jaroszewicz had a conference call with SRR's CEO, Craige Stout, and COO, Ryan Thies to express her concerns about Plaintiff. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 39. On June 23, 2016, [*11]  Thies called Plaintiff to discuss several employment issues, including Plaintiff's receipt of disability benefits from the State of California. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 40. After the phone call, Thies sent Plaintiff an e-mail, summarizing the contents of the phone call. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 41. Thies wrote, "Please let me know if any of the following is incorrect. . . . You did not receive benefits from the State of California related to your earlier leave or this leave and you received rejection letters both times." Dkt. No. 31, Declaration of Ryan Thies ("Thies Decl."), Ex. 1. Plaintiff responded as follows:
I will send you an email after this has been reviewed to either confirm or clarify, or correct each point. Also can you please provide me an email if the firm will give me marketing support and how much as that question was never answered. Also please send to me all communications you have had with the state of California as you have stated you are having difficulties.
Blum Decl. Ex. 32. Plaintiff, however, did not send an e-mail to Thies confirming or correcting the points made in Thies' e-mail. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 42. On July 14, 2016, Plaintiff e-mailed Thies, informing him that he had received [*12]  disability benefits from the State of California totaling $17,506.29 in connection with his 2015 leave and that he needed to pay back that amount to SRR. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 43.
Based on SRR's communications with Plaintiff, SRR formed the belief that Plaintiff had intentionally misled SRR about his receipt of state disability benefits. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 45. After Thies received Plaintiff's July 14, 2016 e-mail informing him that Plaintiff had, in fact, collected state disability benefits, Thies discussed his concerns about Plaintiff with Stout. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 46. According to Thies, Thies and Stout reached the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment as they had lost their trust and confidence in Plaintiff. Pl's Resp. SUF 46. On July 22, 2016, Thies and Stout called Plaintiff to inform him of SRR's decision to terminate his employment as of August 1, 2016, based on their conclusion that he had intentionally misled them about his receipt of state disability benefits while receiving full pay from SRR. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 47.
On July 10, 2016, shortly before Plaintiff was informed of SRR's decision to terminate his employment, Plaintiff e-mailed an SRR senior manager, asking for an explanation [*13]  as to why SRR had set his monthly cell phone reimbursement amount at $40, when it was his understanding that under section 2802 of the California Labor Code, the appropriate reimbursement amount should be $97 plus tax. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 48. Plaintiff asked SRR "to please research and get back to him regarding this new firm policy." Pl.'s Resp. SUF 48.

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Plaintiff's Discrimination Claims under the FEHA Fails.
Plaintiff claims that his cancer diagnosis and resulting disability were a substantial motivating factor in SRR's decision to terminate his employment in violation of the FEHA. See Compl. ¶¶ 34-45.
The FEHA prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on various grounds, including medical condition and disability. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). In evaluating discrimination claims under the FEHA, "California courts look to pertinent federal precedent when applying [its] own statutes." Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). Where there is no "direct evidence" of discrimination, California courts analyze discrimination claims under the three-stage burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corporation v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Id. ("This so-called McDonnell Douglas test reflects the principle that direct evidence of intentional discrimination is rare, and that such claims must usually be proved circumstantially. [*14]  Thus, by successive steps of increasingly narrow focus, the test allows discrimination to be inferred from facts that create a reasonable likelihood of bias and are not satisfactorily explained.").
In the first stage of the McDonnell Douglas test, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. Id. To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, the plaintiff must show that he (1) suffered from a disability, or was regarded as suffering from a disability, (2) could perform the essential duties of the job with or without reasonable accommodations, and (3) was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability or perceived disability. Wills v. Sup. Ct., 195 Cal. App. 4th 143, 159-60, 125 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2011); Avila v. Cont'l Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1237, 1246, 82 Cal. Rptr. 3d 440 (2008). "The burden in this stage is not onerous, and the evidence necessary to satisfy it is minimal." Wills, 195 Cal. App. 4th at 159 (citations omitted).
If the plaintiff meets this burden, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for its employment decision. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355-56; Wills, 195 Cal. App. 4th at 160 (citing Arteaga v. Brink's, Inc., 163 Cal. App. 4th 327, 342-43 (2008)). "This likewise is not an onerous burden, and is generally met by presenting admissible evidence showing the defendant's reason for its employment decision." Wills, 195 Cal. App. 4th at 160.
Finally, if the employer sustains this burden, [*15]  the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the defendant intentionally discriminated against him. Wills, 195 Cal. App. 4th at 160. "The plaintiff may satisfy this burden by proving [that] the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were false, creating an inference that those reasons served as a pretext for discrimination." Id.; Aragon v. Republic Silver State Disposal Inc., 292 F.3d 654, 658-59 (9th Cir. 2002). To establish pretext in this final stage of the McDonnell Douglas test, "very little direct evidence of discriminatory motive is required, but if circumstantial evidence is offered, such evidence has to be specific and substantial." Gardner v. Fed. Express Corp., 114 F. Supp. 3d 889, 896 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (citing Godwin v. Hunt Wesson Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1222 (9th Cir. 1998)).
"A defendant's summary judgment motion slightly modifies the order of these McDonnell Douglas showings." Wills, 195 Cal. App. 4th at 160 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). To prevail on a summary judgment motion, the defendant has the initial burden to either (1) negate an essential element of the plaintiff's prima facie case, or (2) establish a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating the plaintiff's employment. Id. "To avoid summary judgment once the employer makes the foregoing showing, an employee . . . must offer substantial evidence that the employer's stated nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action was untrue or pretextual, [*16]  or evidence the employer acted with a discriminatory animus, or a combination of the two, such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude the employer engaged in intentional discrimination." Id.
SRR contends that the elements of a prima facie case of discrimination have not been met here because (1) SRR continuously granted Plaintiff leaves of absence and allowed him to work from home on a part-time basis at his discretion, (2) SRR continuously paid Plaintiff the equivalent of 100% of his wages during his leaves, and (3) Plaintiff presented no evidence showing that SRR made any derogatory comments relating to Plaintiff's cancer diagnosis. Mot. 20. The Court fails to see how these facts negate any element of Plaintiff's prima facie case. First, it is undisputed that Plaintiff suffered from a disability. Second, SRR does not address whether Plaintiff could perform the essential duties of his job with or without reasonable accommodations. Third, the fact that SRR provided Plaintiff with leaves, a flexible work schedule, and full wages does not preclude the possibility that Plaintiff was subjected to termination because of his disability.
SRR has, however, articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory [*17]  reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment: SRR's belief that Plaintiff lied about whether he had received state disability benefits during his first leave. Under the FEHA, "[f]iring an employee because of honesty and integrity concerns is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for a termination." Day v. Sears Holding Corp., 930 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1170 (C.D. Cal. 2013) (finding that employer articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating employee where employee lied during internal investigation into employee's sexual harassment claim against supervisor). Here, on two separate occasions, Plaintiff indicated to SRR that he had not received state disability benefits. First, in a January 18, 2016 e-mail to Plaintiff, SRR asked two questions, the first regarding how Plaintiff should enter his time while on FMLA leave and the second regarding whether he had received short-term disability benefits from the State of California. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 22; Jaroszewicz Decl. ¶ 19, Ex. 6. Plaintiff responded, "OK, I will record as FMLA and no." Pl.'s Resp. SUF 23. Second, in a June 23, 2016 e-mail memorializing an earlier conversation between Plaintiff and SRR, SRR asked Plaintiff to confirm that he had not received state disability benefits for his [*18]  "earlier leave or this leave" and that he "received rejection letters both times." Thies Decl. Ex. 1. After stating that he would confirm or clarify these points, Plaintiff failed to respond. Blum Decl. Ex. 32; Pl.'s Resp. SUF 42. Given Plaintiff's misleading responses to SRR regarding his receipt of state disability benefits, the Court finds that SRR has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment. See Wills, 195 Cal. App. 4th at 160.
The burden, therefore, shifts to Plaintiff to offer "substantial evidence" that SRR's stated nondiscriminatory reason for terminating his employment was untrue or pretextual, or that SRR acted with a discriminatory animus. See Wills, 195 Cal. App. 4th at 160. Plaintiff fails to carry this burden. As for Plaintiff's first communication with SRR regarding his receipt of state disability benefits, he claims that when he answered, "OK, I will record as FMLA and no," the "no" was not in response to the second question, i.e., whether he had received state disability benefits, but a response to the first directive, i.e., that he should record his time as FMLA and that his time record should reflect actual hours worked. Opp'n 13. To support his contention, Plaintiff points to [*19]  a follow-up e-mail that he sent after his initial response, in which he stated, "Didn't finish my prior response. No, I don't have the records of actual hours worked, but have recorded all chargeable time." Pl.'s Resp. SUF 24; Blum Decl. ¶ 42, Ex. 18. According to Plaintiff, SRR could not have understood his "no" answer to mean that he did not receive state disability benefits given the clarification in his follow-up e-mail. Opp'n 13.
Even assuming that Plaintiff had intended to answer only the first question and not the second, however, Plaintiff fails to provide any evidence showing that SRR did not honestly believe that Plaintiff had answered "no" to the second question. See Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1063 (9th Cir. 2002) (noting that in assessing an employer's proffered reason for terminating an employee, courts "only require that an employer honestly believed its reason for its actions, even if its reason is foolish or trivial or even baseless" (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Moreover, Plaintiff's explanation conflicts with his deposition testimony addressing the meaning of his "no" answer to SRR's inquiry. See Dkt. No. 37, Supplemental Declaration of Thomas Petrides, Ex. 1 (Blum Depo. pp. 176:19-181:2). During his deposition, [*20]  Plaintiff explained that he answered "no" to the question, "While on short-term disability with SRR (in which we paid you 100% of your wages), did you receive short-term disability benefits from the state of California?" because he disagreed with the characterization that he was paid 100% of his wages while on short-term disability leave. Id. The Court finds that the inconsistencies in Plaintiff's explanations add credence to SRR's stated belief that it had been misled by Plaintiff.
As for Plaintiff's second communication with SRR regarding his receipt of state disability benefits, in which SRR asked Plaintiff to confirm that he had not received state disability benefits for his "earlier leave or this leave," Plaintiff claims that he did not respond because SRR did not send him "all communications" that SRR "had with the state of California," as he had requested. Opp'n 17. According to Plaintiff, because SRR failed to send him this information, he was unable to confirm whether he had received state disability benefits during his earlier leave. Opp'n 17. The Court fails to see why Plaintiff would have needed to review the communications between SRR and the EDD to determine whether he [*21]  had received state disability benefits. In fact, Plaintiff admits to having examined his state disability benefits receipts after a call with the EDD, which took place before his second communication with SRR. Opp'n 16.
In sum, Plaintiff has provided no evidence, let alone "substantial evidence," that SRR's stated nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment was untrue or pretextual. SRR is, therefore, entitled to summary judgment as to Plaintiff's discrimination claims.

B. There is Genuine Dispute as to Plaintiff's Reasonable Accommodation Claim, but Not as to Plaintiff's Interactive Process Claim.
Plaintiff alleges that SRR failed to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff's disability and to engage Plaintiff in an interactive process to effect such accommodation, in violation of sections 12940(m) and (n) of the California Government Code. See Compl. ¶ 47. Sections 12940(m) and (n) give rise to two separate causes of action: a reasonable accommodation claim and an interactive process claim. See Swanson v. Morongo Unified Sch. Dist., 232 Cal. App. 4th 954, 971, 181 Cal. Rptr. 3d 553 (2014) ("Although the interactive process is an informal process designed to identify a reasonable accommodation that will enable the employee to perform his or her job effectively, an employer's failure to properly engage in [*22]  the process is separate from the failure to reasonably accommodate an employee's disability and gives rise to an independent cause of action." (citations omitted)).

1. Reasonable Accommodation Claim
Under Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m), [i]t is an unlawful employment practice . . . [f]or an employer . . . to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee." "The elements of a reasonable accommodation cause of action are [that] "(1) the employee suffered a disability, (2) the employee could perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the employee's disability." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 373, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015) (citing Wilson v. Cty. of Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1192, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439; Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 977, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008)). "A reasonable accommodation is a modification or adjustment to the work environment that enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job he or she holds or desires." Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 373.
Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim is based primarily on his contention that he was forced to work during his cancer treatment and recovery because SRR refused to reduce his revenue goal. See Opp'n 10, 14-15, 26-28; Blum Decl. ¶¶ 12-13. SRR responds that it provided Plaintiff with reasonable accommodations by (1) [*23]  permitting Plaintiff to work from home, (2) permitting Plaintiff to work reduced hours at his discretion, and (3) granting Plaintiff's requests for leaves of absence during his cancer treatment and recovery periods. Mot. 29. According to SRR, its refusal to reduce Plaintiff's revenue goal does not give rise to a reasonable accommodation claim because such a request was not a request for a reasonable accommodation that would have allowed Plaintiff to perform the essential functions of his job, but simply a request to receive a prorated portion of an annual bonus. Mot. 17.
The Court finds that a genuine dispute exists as to whether Plaintiff's request for a reduced revenue goal constitutes a request for a reasonable accommodation. If Plaintiff's request for a reduced revenue goal was simply for purposes of receiving a prorated annual bonus, SRR would be correct to argue that such a request was not a request for a reasonable accommodation. See Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 373 (defining reasonable accommodation as one that enables an employee to "perform the essential functions" of his or her job). If Plaintiff's failure to meet his revenue goal went beyond depriving him of an annual bonus and threatened his job security, [*24]  however, Plaintiff's request for a reduced revenue goal may well constitute a request for a reasonable accommodation. Plaintiff claims that he was "written up" for failing to meet his revenue goal. Opp'n 27. In fact, Plaintiff's performance review for 2015 "highlighted" his failure to meet his annual revenue goal. Riley Decl. ¶ 6. Therefore, a trier of fact could find that meeting revenue goals was an essential function of Plaintiff's job, which Plaintiff could have performed had his revenue goal been adjusted.
SRR argues that it was not required to adjust Plaintiff's revenue goal "because lowering or changing a production standard is not a reasonable accommodation employers are required to provide." Mot. 27-28. The cases that SRR cites to support this contention, however, are factually distinguishable: the employees there were not held to revenue goals set for a full year's worth of work after they had missed months of work due to their illnesses or disabilities. See e.g., Kelly v. Amazon.com, Inc., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166534, 2013 WL 6119229, at *8-9 (E.D. Wash. Nov. 21, 2013) (finding that Amazon was not required to tolerate a higher rate of customer dissatisfaction with customer service representative whose endometriosis and migraine headaches affected the tone of her voice); Ciullo v. Yellow Book, USA, Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93912, 2012 WL 2676080, at *4, 11-12 (E.D.N.Y. Jul. 6, 2012) (holding [*25]  that employer was not required to lower employee's sales goal where employee had frequent doctor's appointments and could not work more than 8-hour days); Koerts v. MCI Telecomms. Corp., 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 618, 1997 WL 30987, at *10-11 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 22, 1997) (finding that employer was not liable for terminating employee where employee would have failed to satisfy her sales goal even if she were given five additional days, the exact number of days that employee was absent from work due to her disability).
Moreover, SRR's cases analyze reasonable accommodation claims that were brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). While ADA cases "may be useful to guide the construction of the FEHA . . ., the duty of an employer to provide reasonable accommodation for an employee with a disability is broader under the FEHA than under the ADA." Bagatti v. Dep't of Rehab., 97 Cal. App. 4th 344, 358, 362, 118 Cal. Rptr. 2d 443 (2002).
Accordingly, SRR is not entitled to summary judgment as to Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim.

2. Interactive Process Claim
Under Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n), "[i]t is an unlawful employment practice . . . [f]or an employer . . . to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with [*26]  a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition."
According to Plaintiff, SRR failed to engage in the interactive process to effect reasonable accommodations because it (1) held no meeting or inquired with Plaintiff to determine reasonable accommodations for his cancer diagnosis and treatment, and (2) initiated no dialogue on adjusting Plaintiff's productivity goals in light of his medical condition. Opp'n 28. The Court disagrees. Although "[t]he interactive process imposes burdens on both the employer and employee," "[t]he employee must initiate the process unless the disability and resulting limitations are obvious." Scotch v. Art Inst. of California-Orange Cty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1013, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009); see also Swanson, 232 Cal. App. 4th at 971. "Where the disability, resulting limitations, and necessary reasonable accommodations, are not open, obvious, and apparent to the employer, the initial burden rests primarily upon the employee to specifically identify the disability and resulting limitations, and to suggest the reasonable accommodations." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1013 (citation omitted). Contrary to Plaintiff's contention, therefore, the burden was not on SRR to inquire with Plaintiff to determine reasonable accommodations or to initiate dialogue on adjusting Plaintiff's revenue goals.
Once the employee [*27]  initiates the process, however, "the employer has a continuous obligation to engage in the interactive process in good faith." Swanson, 232 Cal. App. 4th at 971. "Each party must participate in good faith, undertake reasonable efforts to communicate its concerns, and make available to the other information which is available, or more accessible, to one party." Id. at 972.
Here, undisputed facts show that SRR continuously engaged in the interactive process with Plaintiff. At Plaintiff's request, SRR allowed him to work from home for two weeks after radiation treatment and to work reduced hours at his discretion. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 3, 7; Jaroszewics Decl. ¶ 4; Compl. ¶ 9. When Plaintiff informed SRR that he needed time off for surgery, SRR granted his request. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 28. When Plaintiff informed SRR that he was on "brain altering medication," SRR informed Plaintiff of its preference that he not work while on such medication until he could provide medical documentation showing that he was able to perform his duties. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 31-32. Although SRR decided not to grant Plaintiff's request for a prorated revenue goal, SRR engaged in an interactive process with Plaintiff in reaching that decision. See Pl.'s Resp. SUF 11; [*28]  Riley Decl. ¶ 7. SRR is, therefore, entitled to summary judgment as to Plaintiff's interactive process claim.

C. Plaintiff's Wrongful Termination Claim Fails.
Plaintiff alleges that SRR wrongfully terminated his employment in violation of public policy, after he protested against SRR's unlawful expense reimbursement policy for employee cell phone use. See Compl. ¶ 53.
As with a FEHA claim, when a plaintiff alleges a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy, California courts conduct the three-stage burden-shifting analysis of McDonnell Douglas Corporation v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Loggins v. Kaiser Permanente Int'l, 151 Cal. App. 4th 1102, 1108-09, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 45 (2007). In the first stage, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of wrongful termination by showing that (1) he engaged in a protected activity, (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action. Loggins, 151 Cal. App. 4th at 1109 (citing Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005)). If the employee succeeds in making this showing, the burden shifts to the employer to provide evidence that there was a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. Loggins, 151 Cal. App. 4th at 1109 (citing Morgan v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 88 Cal. App. 4th 52, 68, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 652 (2000)). If the employer produces evidence showing a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action, the burden shifts back to the [*29]  employee to provide "substantial responsive evidence" that the employer's proffered reasons were untrue or pretextual. Loggins, 151 Cal. App. 4th at 1109 (citing Martin v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., 29 Cal. App. 4th 1718, 1735, 35 Cal. Rptr. 2d 181 (1994)).
On an employer's motion for summary judgment, however, the employer has the initial burden of showing either that the plaintiff cannot establish one or more of the elements of his prima facie case, or that there was a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for terminating the plaintiff's employment. See Wills, 195 Cal. App. 4th at 160.
Here, SRR fails to negate any element of Plaintiff's prima facie case of wrongful termination. First, Plaintiff has shown that he engaged in a protected activity: confronting SRR with allegations of a labor code violation. "[F]iring an employee for complaining about labor [code] violations would clearly violate public policy." Monaghan v. Telecom Italia Sparkle of N. Am., Inc., 2013 WL 12171957, at *9 (C.D. Cal. Jul. 22, 2013) (finding that employee's complaint about being misclassified as an independent contractor and employer's failure to pay wages in violation of the labor code was protected activity); see also Reid v. Concentra Health Servs., Inc., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49724, 2015 WL 1729873, at *12 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 15, 2015) ("This court has elaborated that 'protected activity' involves some level of opposition to the employer's actions based on the employee's reasonable belief that some act or practice of the employer is unlawful."); Malloian v. Infinity Ins. Co., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134361, 2011 WL 5860073, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 21, 2011) (holding that communicating concerns [*30]  about employer's alleged failure to pay overtime in violation of the labor code constitutes protected activity). Second, it is undisputed that Plaintiff was subjected to the adverse employment action of termination. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 47. Third, temporal proximity alone - SRR terminated Plaintiff's employment on August 1, 2016, just 22 days after Plaintiff sent his e-mail to SRR inquiring about its reimbursement policy - is sufficient to make a prima facie showing of a causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action. See e.g., Villiarimo, 281 F.3d at 1065 (noting that a prima facie showing of "causation can be inferred from timing alone where an adverse employment action follows on the heels of protected activity"); Hooker v. Parker Hannifin Corp., 548 Fed. Appx. 368, 370 (9th Cir. Nov. 20, 2013).
SRR, however, has produced evidence showing a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment: that Plaintiff lied about having received state disability benefits. Pl.'s Resp. SUF 22-23, 38, 42. The burden, therefore, shifts to Plaintiff to provide "substantial responsive evidence" that SRR's proffered reason was untrue or pretextual. See Loggins, 151 Cal. App. 4th at 1109. Here, aside from Plaintiff's contention that he did not lie about having received state disability benefits, the temporal [*31]  proximity between the protected activity and the adverse employment action is Plaintiff's only basis for arguing that SRR's proffered reason for terminating his employment was pretextual. "While evidence of temporal proximity is sufficient to demonstrate a prima facie case of retaliation, the first step in the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting test, it is ordinarily insufficient to satisfy the second burden to prove evidence of pretext." Hooker, 548 Fed. Appx. at 370; see also Huck v. Kone, Inc., 539 Fed. Appx. 754, 755 (9th Cir. Aug. 26, 2013) (noting that plaintiff's "only evidence of discrimination was the temporal proximity of his termination to his medical leave, which is insufficient to prove pretext"); Lawler v. Montblanc N. Am., LLC, 704 F.3d 1235, 1244 (9th Cir. 2013) (holding that temporal proximity between plaintiff's complaint against employer and termination of her employment "does not constitute a 'substantial' offering sufficient to overcome [the employer's] proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating her employment").
To be sure, courts that have held that "[i]n some cases, temporal proximity can by itself constitute sufficient circumstantial evidence of retaliation for purposes of both the prima facie case and the showing of pretext." Dawson v. Entek Int'l, 630 F.3d 928, 937 (9th Cir. 2011); see also Passantino v. Johnson & Johnson Consumer Prod., Inc., 212 F.3d 493, 507 (9th Cir. 2000) ("[W]e have held that evidence based on timing can be sufficient [*32]  to let the issue go to the jury, even in the face of alternative reasons proffered by the defendant."). In these cases, however, it is unclear whether temporal proximity was, in fact, the sole basis for the courts' determination that the employee had made a showing of pretext. See Dawson, 630 F.3d at 933, 937 (noting that "gravity of Dawson's complaints" which included repeated verbal abuse from supervisor and co-workers based on Dawson's sexual orientation, "coupled with the time frame [between Dawson's complaints to human resources and his termination] are such that a reasonable trier of fact could find in favor of Dawson on his retaliation claim"); see also Passantino, 212 F.3d at 507 (citing Strother v. S. Cal. Permanente Med. Grp., 79 F.3d 859, 870 (9th Cir. 1996) (holding that letter from employer stating that plaintiff - who was eventually fired for lacking interpersonal skills - was "literally able to get along in any situation with anyone," along with temporal proximity, was sufficient to raise triable issue of fact precluding summary judgment)).
The Court finds, therefore, that Plaintiff has failed to carry the burden of showing that SRR's proffered reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment was untrue or pretextual. Accordingly, SRR is entitled to summary judgment as to Plaintiff's wrongful termination [*33]  claim.

V. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART the Motion. Specifically, the Court:
• GRANTS the Motion as to Plaintiff's discrimination claims, interactive process claim, and wrongful termination claim.
• DENIES the Motion as to Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim.
