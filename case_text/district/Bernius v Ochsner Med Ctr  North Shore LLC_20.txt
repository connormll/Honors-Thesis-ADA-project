Opinion



ORDER AND REASONS
Before the Court is a Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Motion for a More Definite Statement (R. Doc. 20) filed by Defendants, Ochsner Medical Center — North Shore, LLC and Ochsner Health System ("Defendants") an opposition thereto (R. Doc. 26) filed by Plaintiff, Shari Bernius, both individually and on behalf of the Estate of Helen Arcuri ("Plaintiffs"), and a reply filed by Defendants (R. Doc. 27). Having considered the motion [*2]  and legal memoranda, the record, and the applicable law, the Court finds that the motion should be GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs' complaint centers around allegations that Defendants failed to provide a deaf patient with interpretive services. According to the complaint, Helen Arcuri was a profoundly deaf individual who communicated primarily through American Sign Language. (R. Doc. 1, at 5.) Ms. Arcuri had limited proficiency in written English and required assistance to communicate in a medical setting. Id. Shari Bernius is Ms. Arcuri's daughter, and she is not hearing-impaired. Id. Plaintiffs allege that Ms. Arcuri had been receiving treatment from Ochsner Medical Center — North Shore (Ochsner) since 2011, and that Ochsner staff were aware that Ms. Arcuri was profoundly deaf and required an interpreter. (R. Doc. 1, at 6.)
Plaintiffs allege that on or about September 22, 2015, Ms. Bernius brought her mother, Ms. Arcuri, to Ochsner because Ms. Arcuri was feeling weak. Id. at 5-6. At that point, Ms. Arcuri was diagnosed with congestive heart failure and a urinary tract infection, and was admitted to Ochsner. Id. at 6. The complaint alleges that Ms. Arcuri's [*3]  treating physician, Dr. Sultan, was aware that Ms. Arcuri required an interpreter. Id. Further, Plaintiffs allege that Ms. Bernius alerted Ochsner staff that her mother needed an interpreter, placed a note in Ms. Arcuri's hospital room that stated "patient is deaf", and provided contact information for both Ms. Bernius and an interpreting agency. Id.
Plaintiffs allege that Ochsner failed to comply with Ms. Bernius' requests that it provide sign language interpreter services. Id. at 7. Because of this failure, the complaint alleges, Ms. Arcuri suffered. For example, Plaintiffs allege that when Ms. Arcuri pressed the call button in her room for assistance, the nurses responded to the call orally. Id. Plaintiffs allege that because Ms. Arcuri could not hear the nurses' oral responses, Ms. Arcuri could not communicate her needs. Id. Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that Ochsner staff provided Ms. Arcuri with only Tylenol for severe pain even though she had been prescribed hydrocodone for severe arthritis, and that this led to insufficient pain management and symptoms of withdrawal. Id. at 7. Plaintiffs allege that instead of providing an interpreter, hospital staff attempted to communicate with Ms. Arcuri [*4]  by forcing her to read lips and gesturing, a method of communication that Plaintiffs allege is inadequate for communicating the complexities inherent in the medical setting. Id. at 8. Plaintiffs allege that Ms. Bernius objected to this form of communication, but that Ochsner staff insisted Ms. Arcuri was capable of reading lips. Ultimately, the complaint alleges, Ochsner discharged Ms. Arcuri while she remained in a weakened condition despite objections from Ms. Bernius. Id.
Plaintiffs allege that on or about October 10, 2015, less than a month after her discharge from Ochsner, Ms. Arcuri fell and was transported back to Ochsner. Id. Plaintiffs allege that, once again, Ms. Bernius informed the staff of her mother's need for an interpreter, instructed Ochsner staff on how to get her mother's attention, wrote on the board in Ms. Arcuri's hospital bed that "patient is deaf," and provided both her own contact information and contact information for an interpreting agency. Id. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs allege that when a nurse from a rehabilitation agency came to meet with Ms. Arcuri at the hospital, Ms. Bernius was forced to serve as an interpreter because no interpreter was provided by Ochsner. [*5]  The complaint alleges that on October 14, 2015, Ms. Arcuri was released from Ochsner to a rehabilitation facility, against the wishes of Ms. Bernius. Id. at 9. The complaint alleges that Ms. Arcuri died on October 14, 2015 at the rehabilitation facility. Id.
Ms. Bernius brought suit, both individually and on behalf of the Estate of Ms. Arcuri, against Defendants on September 15, 2016, alleging violations of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 ("Rehabilitation Act"), Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 42 U.S.C. § 18116 ("ACA"), and the Louisiana Commission on Human Rights, La. Rev. Stat. § 51:2231 et seq. ("LCHR"). Plaintiffs' complaint alleges these violations on behalf of both Ms. Arcuri and Ms. Bernius. Plaintiffs request declaratory relief, as well as compensatory damages, reasonable costs and attorneys' fees, and interest on all amounts at the highest rates and from the earliest dates allowed by law. The complaint alleges that Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief, but does not request it in the prayer for relief. See (R. Doc. 1, at 14.)
Ochsner filed the instant Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Motion for More Definite Statement (R. Doc. 20) on November 1, 2016. The Court heard oral argument on this motion [*6]  on November 16, 2016.

PARTIES' ARGUMENTS
Defendants argue that Ms. Bernius lacks standing to bring a claim under the Rehabilitation Act, Section 1557 of the ACA, and the LCHR. In particular, Defendants argue that associational standing under the Rehabilitation Act and the ACA requires that a non-disabled plaintiff be personally excluded, denied benefits, or discriminated against because of her association with a disabled person. Defendants further argue that similar requirements apply for a non-disabled person to have standing pursuant to the LCHR.1
Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs' complaint should be dismissed as premature because Plaintiffs have already asserted a claim under the Louisiana Medical Malpractice Act ("MAA") in state court. Because the MMA requires the completion of review by a medical review panel prior to bringing any other cause of action against a qualified health care provider, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' civil action in this Court should be dismissed as premature until the medical review panel's review is completed. Defendants also argue that abstention doctrines are applicable and justify either dismissing the case as premature or staying it. Additionally, Defendants assert that because Ms. [*7]  Arcuri is no longer alive, there is no real or immediate threat she will be injured again and that Ms. Bernius has not demonstrated a risk of future harm. Thus, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief should be dismissed. Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' requests for emotional distress damages pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act, Section 1557 of the ACA, and the LCHR should be dismissed because those statutes do not provide for emotional distress damages.
In response, Plaintiffs argue that Ms. Bernius has standing to assert a claim under the Rehabilitation Act, the ACA, and the LCHR through her association with Ms. Arcuri. Plaintiffs argue that a non-disabled individual has standing under the Rehabilitation Act so long as she establishes an injury causally related to, but separate and distinct from, a disabled person's injury. Furthermore, Plaintiffs argue that Ms. Bernius suffered such an injury when she was forced to act as an interpreter for Ms. Arcuri while at Ochsner.
Plaintiffs also argue that their Rehabilitation Act and ACA claims should not be dismissed as premature because these are federal claims based upon federal statutes and are therefore not subjected to Louisiana state civil [*8]  procedure requirements. Plaintiffs argue that the Fifth Circuit does not require a Rehabilitation Act claimant to exhaust all administrative remedies prior to bringing the claim, and so it would be inconsistent for this Court to require it. Additionally, Plaintiffs argue that claims for emotional distress are available under the Rehabilitation Act, Section 1557 of the ACA, and the LCHR. Finally, Plaintiffs' opposition memorandum does not address Ochsner's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief.

LEGAL STANDARD
In deciding a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), "the district court is 'free to weigh the evidence and resolve factual disputes in order to satisfy itself that it has the power to hear the case.'" Krim v. pcOrder.com, Inc., 402 F.3d 489, 494 (5th Cir. 2005). The party asserting jurisdiction must carry the burden of proof for a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss. Randall D. Wolcott, M.D., P.A. v. Sebelius, 635 F.3d 757, 762 (5th Cir. 2011). The standard of review for a facial challenge to a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) is the same as that for a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). United States v. City of New Orleans, No. 02-3618, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16765, 2003 WL 22208578, at *1 (E.D. La. Sept. 19, 2003); see also 13 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3522 (3d ed. 2008). If a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, it should dismiss without prejudice. In re Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 624 F.3d 201, 209 (5th Cir. 2010).
To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must plead enough [*9]  facts to "state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible when the plaintiff pleads facts that allow the court to "draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id. A court must accept all well-pleaded facts as true and must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. Lormand v. U.S. Unwired, Inc., 565 F.3d 228, 232-33 (5th Cir. 2009); Baker v. Putnal, 75 F.3d 190, 196 (5th Cir. 1996). The court is not, however, bound to accept as true legal conclusions couched as factual allegations. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. "[C]onclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss." Taylor v. Books A Million, Inc., 296 F.3d 376, 378 (5th Cir. 2002).

DISCUSSION

Associational Standing Under the Rehabilitation Act and ACA
At issue here is the scope of associational standing under the Rehabilitation Act and Section 1557 of the ACA, and in particular, what type of injury is required to obtain such standing. Both parties agree that Section 1557 of the ACA incorporates the Rehabilitation Act's definition of disability and provides the same protections for people with disabilities as the Rehabilitation Act. Thus, analysis of the Rehabilitation Act will apply to Ms. Bernius' ACA claim.2
Ms. Bernius alleges a personal Rehabilitation Act and ACA claim for an injury she alleges to have sustained through her association with Ms. Arcuri. Courts generally agree that under the Rehabilitation Act, "non-disabled individuals have standing to bring claims when they are injured because of their association with a disabled person." McCullum v. Orlando Reg'l Healthcare Sys., Inc., 768 F.3d 1135, 1142 (11th Cir. 2014) (collecting cases). However, two federal circuits have come to different conclusions about the type of injury a non-disabled Rehabilitation Act claimant must experience. See McCullum, 768 F.3d at 1143-44; Loeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 279 (2d Cir. 2009). Having been persuaded by the logic expressed in the Eleventh Circuit's McCullum v. Orlando Regional Healthcare and the dissent in the Second Circuit's Loeffler v. Staten Island University Hospital, this Court employs McCullum's more narrow definition of associational standing.
As an initial matter, it is noteworthy that Ms. Bernius brings her claim pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act, and not the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). See 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. Associational standing is recognized under both [*11]  Acts, but only the ADA sets forth a clear statutory definition. The ADA provides: "It shall be discriminatory to exclude or otherwise deny equal goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, accommodations, or other opportunities to an individual or entity because of the known disability of an individual with whom the individual or entity is known to have a relationship or association." 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(E). Thus, the ADA provision requires that "an associated person be actually excluded or denied due to their association." Loeffler, 582 F.3d at 286 (Jacobs, C.J., dissenting in part).
The Rehabilitation Act's provision on associational standing is less specific. It makes a remedy "available to any person aggrieved by any act or failure to act by any" entity subject to the Rehabilitation Act. See 29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(2) (emphasis added). However, section 794a(2) is set within a larger statutory context. Section 794(a), which is the Rehabilitation Act statute forbidding discrimination, states that "[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded in the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity" covered by the Rehabilitation Act [*12] . 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). The parties disagree about whether section 794(a) acts as a limitation upon the otherwise broadly worded associational standing provision in section 794a(a)(2).
Plaintiffs request the Court to conclude that the different definitions for associational standing in the ADA and Rehabilitation Act imply a Congressional intent to provide for a broader scope of associational standing under the Rehabilitation Act. In support of their argument, Plaintiffs point to Supreme Court dicta stating that "the word 'any' has an expansive meaning." United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5, 117 S. Ct. 1032, 137 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1997). Thus, Plaintiffs assert that section 794a(a)(2)'s reference to "any person aggrieved" should be read to mean just that—any person. Plaintiffs also ask the Court to adopt the Second Circuit's holding in Loeffler. See Loeffler, 582 F.3d at 279 (Wesley, J., concurring in part). There, the children of a deaf man brought a claim under the Rehabilitation Act because they were required to provide sign language interpretation between their father and the hospital, and because they were taken from school to do so and involuntarily exposed to their father's suffering. Id. at 279-80. The Loeffler court held that "non-disabled parties bringing associational discrimination claims need only prove an independent injury causally related to the denial [*13]  of federally required services to the disabled persons with whom the non-disabled plaintiffs are associated." Id. at 279. In so doing, the Loeffler court held that section 794(a) is distinct from section 794a(a)(2), and therefore, a non-disabled person need not suffer an "exclusion from the participation in, denial of the benefits of, or subjection to discrimination" in order to have associational standing. Id. at 280 (internal citations omitted). Rather, the court held that a non-disabled plaintiff only must establish "an injury causally related to, but separate and distinct from, a disabled person's injury under the [Rehabilitation Act]." Id.
As Chief Judge Jacobs noted in dissent, the Loeffler majority's "wide interpretation of 'any person aggrieved' has no evident limiting principle. . . ." Id. at 287 (Jacobs, C.J., dissenting in part). This Court shares the concerns expressed by Chief Judge Jacobs, and therefore adopts the Eleventh Circuit's holding in McCullum. See McCullum, 768 F.3d at 1143. There, the court held that the statutory context of section 794(a) serves to limit the scope of section 794a(a)(2). Id. In McCullum, the parents of a deaf son brought suit individually and on behalf of the deaf son's sister against a hospital for failing to provide interpretive services during the period the [*14]  boy was in the hospital. Id. at 1138-39. When analyzing the scope of section 794a(a)(2), the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged that "'any' is a powerful and broad word," but also noted that the Supreme Court has stated that "'broad language is not limitless' and 'a liberal construction nonetheless can find limits in a text's language, context, history, and purposes." Id. at 1142-43 (quoting Watson v. Philip Morris Cos., 551 U.S. 142, 147, 127 S. Ct. 2301, 168 L. Ed. 2d 42 (2007)). Therefore, the court held that non-disabled plaintiffs only have associational standing under the Rehabilitation Act when "they allege that they were personally excluded, personally denied benefits, or personally discriminated against because of their association with a disabled person." Id. at 1143.
Requiring personal exclusion, denial of benefits, or personal discrimination is consistent with the ADA's instruction that "nothing in [the ADA] shall be construed to apply a lesser standard than the standards applied under" Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. See 42 U.S.C. § 12201(a); see also Frame v. City of Arlington, 657 F.3d 215, 223 (5th Cir. 2011) ("The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act generally are interpreted in pari materia."). As described above, the ADA's associational standing provision requires the non-disabled individual to be "exclude[d] or otherwise deni[ed] equal goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, accommodations, or other opportunities" [*15]  because of her association with a disabled person. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(E). Adopting the associational standing requirements requested by Plaintiffs would result in the application of different standards for the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. See McCullum, 768 F.3d at 1143. The Court declines to apply these inconsistent standards.
Here, Ms. Bernius fails to allege that she was personally excluded, denied benefits, or discriminated against because of her association with Ms. Arcuri.3 The extent of Ms. Bernius' alleged injury is that she was forced into a professional role as interpreter for Ms. Arcuri because Ochsner failed to provide an interpreter. This does not satisfy the requirements for associational standing. Thus, Ms. Bernius' Rehabilitation Act and ACA claims are dismissed.

Exhaustion of State Administrative Procedures
Louisiana's Medical Malpractice Act (MMA) provides that "[n]o action against a health care provider covered by this Part, or his insurer, may be commenced in any court before the claimant's proposed complaint has been presented to a medical review panel. . . ." La. Rev. Stat. § 40:1231.8(B)(1)(a)(i) (effective Aug. 1, 2016) (formerly La. Rev. Stat. § 40:1299.47(B)(1)(a)(i)). The parties agree that Plaintiffs, in addition to filing the instant suit in this Court, have also [*16]  filed a request for review by a medical review panel in Louisiana state court. Furthermore, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' request for review by the medical review panel is "almost identical" to the complaint in the instant suit, and Plaintiffs do not dispute that assessment. (R. Doc. 20-1, at 10.) Defendants argue that even if Plaintiffs' complaint alleges causes of action that fall outside of Plaintiffs' medical malpractice claim, the two claims overlap enough that Plaintiffs should be required to abide by the MMA's claim procedure. Therefore, Defendants request that the Court dismiss the instant suit as premature.
Defendants support their argument with cases where plaintiffs attempted to "circumvent the confines of the [MMA]" by couching medical malpractice actions as other state law causes of action. (R. Doc. 20-1, at 12) (citing Richardson v. Advanced Cardiovascular Sys., Inc., 865 F. Supp. 1210, 1218 (E.D. La. 1994). For instance, in McKnight v. D & W Health Services, the mother of a deceased nursing home resident sued the nursing home and its insurer under Louisiana's Nursing Home Residents' Bill of Rights (NHRBR), alleging that her son died because of the nursing home's negligence and fault. 2002-2552, p. 2 (La. App. 1 Cir. 11/3/03); 873 So. 2d 18, 20; see La. Rev. Stat. § 40:2010.8 et seq. The McKnight court found that at its core, the complaint stated a cause [*17]  of action for medical malpractice. Id. at 23. The court noted, "[T]he fact that plaintiff may have concurrent and overlapping causes of action for both medical malpractice and violation of the NHRBR does not change the fact that most, if not all, of the alleged wrongful acts fall within the parameters of the MMA." Id. Because medical malpractice claims asserted under the NHRBR are encompassed within the MMA, the court concluded that review by a medical review panel must occur prior to suit when the defendant is a qualified health care provider. Id. (citing Richard v. La. Extended Care Ctrs., Inc., 02-0978, p. 11 (La. 1/14/03); 835 So. 2d 460, 467); see also Rivera v. Bolden's Transp. Serv., Inc., 2011-1669, p. 4, (La. App. 1 Cir. 6/28/12); 97 So. 3d 1096, 1099 ("If a lawsuit against a health care provider covered by the [MMA] has been commenced in a court and the complaint has not been first presented to a medical review panel, . . . the claimant's suit must be dismissed.").
However, Plaintiffs accurately note that all cases referred to by Defendants involve state law claims that fall within the penumbra of the MMA. See McKnight, 873 So. 2d at 23. By contrast, Plaintiffs here have alleged claims sounding in federal law in addition to their request for review by a medical review panel in Louisiana state court. Thus, Plaintiffs argue that their federal causes of actions need not comply with state law civil procedure. [*18] 
Plaintiffs' argument relies upon principles of federal conflict and field preemption.
Those principles make clear that a federal requirement pre-empts a state requirement if (1) the state requirement actually conflicts with the federal requirement-either because compliance with both is impossible, Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 83 S.Ct. 1210, 1217-1218, 10 L.Ed.2d 248 (1963), or because the state requirement 'stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,' Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 404, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1941)-or (2) the scheme of federal regulation is "so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it," Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S. Ct. 1146, 91 L. Ed. 1447 (1947).
Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 507-508, 116 S. Ct. 2240, 135 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1996). Plaintiffs do not point to a federal requirement or directive that Rehabilitation Act claims are not required to abide by state civil procedure requirements; rather, Plaintiffs direct the Court to McNeese v. Board of Education for Community Unit School District 187, Cahokia, Illinois. 373 U.S. 668, 83 S. Ct. 1433, 10 L. Ed. 2d 622 (1963). There, the Supreme Court stated that "relief under the Civil Rights Act may not be defeated because relief was not first sought under state law which provided a remedy." Id. at 671. The Court continued: "The federal remedy is supplementary to the state remedy, and the latter need not be first sought and refused before the federal one is invoked." Id. (quoting Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 183, 81 S. Ct. 473, 5 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1961)). Thus, the Court declined to hold [*19]  "that assertion of a federal claim in a federal court must await an attempt to vindicate the same claim in a state court." Id. at 672.
Fifth Circuit precedent supports the conclusion that Plaintiffs' federal complaint should not be dismissed as premature. The court has held that "although a plaintiff must exhaust his or her administrative remedies before pursuing a Rehabilitation Act claim against a federal agency, it need not do so before suing a federal grantee." Taylor v. City of Shreveport, 798 F.3d 276, 284 (5th Cir. 2015) (emphasis in original); see also Prewitt v. United States Postal Serv., 662 F.2d 311, 314 (5th Cir. 1981) ("Prewitt II") (making the same distinction between federal agencies and federal grantees). Because neither party disputes that Defendant is a federal grantee, exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required. See (R. Doc. 1, at 10) ("At all times, Defendants have been a program or activity receiving federal financial assistance pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)."). Nothing in Taylor or Prewitt II lead to the conclusion that Rehabilitation Act plaintiffs may bypass federal administrative remedies, but still be subject to state administrative remedies.
Ultimately, the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution controls the disposition of this issue. See U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. Plaintiffs have brought a federal claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Congress did not create an administrative exhaustion [*20]  requirement when it passed the Rehabilitation Act, and the Fifth Circuit has held that administrative exhaustion is not required in the pursuit of a Rehabilitation Act claim when the defendant is a federal grantee. See Taylor, 798 F.3d at 284. Congress' purpose in passing the Rehabilitation Act was to "empower individuals with disabilities to maximize employment, economic self-sufficiency, independence, and inclusion and integration into society." See 29 U.S.C. § 701(b)(1); see also Frame v. City of Arlington, 657 F.3d 215, 230-31 (5th Cir. 2011) (discussing the purpose of the Rehabilitation Act and ADA). The Rehabilitation Act attempts to achieve this goal by providing a private cause of action to obtain relief in federal court. See Prewitt v. U.S. Postal Service, 662 F.2d 292 (5th Cir. 1981) ("Prewitt I") (discussing the history and purpose of the Rehabilitation Act). Requiring a Rehabilitation Act plaintiff to exhaust state administrative procedures would stand as an obstacle to the congressional intent of the Rehabilitation Act. See Smith v. State of Ind., 904 F. Supp. 877, 880 (N.D. Ind. 1995) (finding, in the ADA context, that "[t]he defendant may not use the Indiana Medical Malpractice Act's requirement of presentation of claims to a medical review panel as a means to trump the plaintiff's claim under federal law"). Accordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss Ms. Arcuri's Rehabilitation Act and ACA claims [*21]  as premature is denied.4

Louisiana Commission on Human Rights Claim
Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that Defendants discriminated against both Ms. Arcuri and Ms. Bernius in violation of the Louisiana Commission on Human Rights (LCHR). (Rec. Doc. 1, at 14.) The LCHR provides:
Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, it is a discriminatory practice for a person to deny an individual the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of a place of public accommodation, resort, or amusement, as defined in this Chapter, on the grounds of race, creed, color, religion, sex, age, disability, as defined in R.S. 51:2232(11), or national origin.
La. Rev. Stat. § 51:2247. Unlike Plaintiffs' Rehabilitation Act and ACA claims, the LCHR claim is subject to the same procedural requirements as other Louisiana state law claims that have substantial overlap with the MMA claim. As discussed above, Plaintiffs do not dispute that the instant complaint and their request for review by a medical review panel are "nearly identical." Furthermore, Louisiana Revised Statute § 40:1231.8(B)(1)(a)(i) clearly requires that the proposed complaint be presented to a medical review panel prior to the commencement of an action [*22]  in any court. Thus, Plaintiffs' LCHR claims, with respect to both Ms. Bernius and Ms. Arcuri, are dismissed as premature.

Injunctive Relief
Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief should be dismissed. Plaintiffs do not oppose this motion. "[A] plaintiff seeking injunctive relief based on an alleged past wrong must show that there is a real or immediate threat that he will be harmed again." Plumley v. Landmark Chevrolet, Inc., 122 F.3d 308, 312 (5th Cir. 1997) (citing City of L.A. v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983)). In this case, Ms. Arcuri has died, so there is no real or immediate threat that she will be harmed again. Therefore, Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief is granted.

Emotional Distress Damages
In their complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' failure to provide Ms. Arcuri with adequate interpretive services caused her "to experience fear, anxiety, indignity, humiliation, and/or emotional distress." (R. Doc. 1, at 9.) Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants and their physicians and staff knew or should have known that their actions created an unreasonable risk of creating these symptoms in Ms. Arcuri, and that Defendants discriminated against Ms. Arcuri with deliberate indifference to her communication needs. Id. at 9-10. In their opposition [*23]  memorandum, Plaintiffs clarify that they are bringing claims for emotional distress pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act, Section 1557 of the ACA, and the LCHR. (R. Doc. 26, at 25.) Defendants argue that neither the Rehabilitation Act, Section 1557 of the ACA, or the LCHR provide for an award of emotional damages.
The Court declines to decide whether the LCHR provides for emotional distress claims because these claims are being dismissed as premature. Additionally, the Court declines to decide whether emotional distress claims are available under the Rehabilitation Act and the ACA at this stage in litigation because the parties have not fully briefed the issue.

CONCLUSION
Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Motion for a More Definite Statement (R. Doc. 20) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants' motion to dismiss Ms. Bernius' Rehabilitation Act claim and ACA claim is GRANTED. Ms. Bernius' Rehabilitation Claim and ACA claim are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants' motion to dismiss Ms. Arcuri's Rehabilitation Act claim and ACA claim as premature is DENIED.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' LCHR [*24]  claims as premature is GRANTED. Plaintiffs' LCHR claims are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief is GRANTED.
New Orleans, Louisiana this 15th day of December, 2016.
