Opinion



ORDER
Viorel Cotuna, a pro se Florida resident, appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment for the defendant in this civil suit asserting claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Michigan's Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act ("ELCRA"), the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), Michigan's Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act ("PWDCRA"), the Equal Pay Act ("EPA"), and Michigan's Compiled Laws ("Mich. Comp. Laws") §§ 408.473, 408.474, and 408.475. This case has been referred to a panel of the court that, upon examination, unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a).
Viorel Cotuna is a physically disabled Romanian man. In 2002, he began working for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart") at a store in Michigan. Walmart promoted Cotuna to assistant manager of a store in Livonia, Michigan, in 2006. Cotuna alleges that [*2]  in 2011, his supervisor, Vicki Ashton-Hendrixson denied him and other similarly situated male coworkers an increase in pay, which was granted to similarly situated female coworkers; unfairly scheduled him; and otherwise harassed him and denied him opportunities. In August and November 2011, Cotuna requested and was granted medical leave due to his back problems. In November 2012 Cotuna filed another leave request, and in December 2012 he filed a complaint against Ashton-Hendrixson. Walmart denied the leave request and terminated both Ashton-Hendrixson and Cotuna in January 2013.
In January 2014, after receiving a right-to-sue letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Cotuna filed a complaint against Walmart, and amended his complaint in August 2014. In the amended complaint, Cotuna raised the following claims: (1) discrimination based on gender in violation of Title VII and the ELCRA; (2) discrimination based on national origin in violation of Title VII and the ELCRA; (3) discrimination based on disability in violation of the ADA; (4) failure to accommodate in violation of the ADA and the PWDCRA; (5) refusal to grant him a promotion in violation of the EPA; and (6) violations [*3]  of Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 408.473, 408.474, and 408.475.
In October 2014, Walmart moved for dismissal, and in March 2015 the district court dismissed the gender-discrimination claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. In November 2015, Walmart filed a motion for summary judgment. At the summary judgment hearing, Cotuna withdrew his Michigan compensation claim.
The district court granted Walmart's motion for summary judgment with respect to all of Cotuna's remaining claims. Specifically, it granted summary judgment on: (1) the failure to accommodate claim because Cotuna failed to provide medical documentation for the accommodations he requested; (2) the ADA discriminatory discharge claim because Cotuna failed to show that he was able to perform his job, and failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that the reason for dismissal was pretextual; (3) the EPA claim because it was time-barred and because no female assistant managers received a greater raise; (4) the discrimination claims based on national origin and the disability claims because his allegations were insufficient to sustain a claim of a hostile work environment; and (5) the retaliation claim because a sixteen-month leave with insufficient medical documentation [*4]  is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for termination and Cotuna failed to show pretext.
Cotuna now appeals. He argues that his request for medical accommodation was reasonable, that female colleagues did receive a raise in April 2011, and that the EPA claim is within the statute of limitations because he was continually subjected to discriminatory acts. He also repeats his allegations regarding his hostile-workplace and retaliation claims.
"We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo." Tyson v. Sterling Rental, Inc., 836 F.3d 571, 576 (6th Cir. 2016). Summary judgment is appropriate when "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A genuine dispute of material fact exists if "there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). In applying the summary judgment standard, the court must review all materials supplied, including pleadings, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). If the evidence is merely colorable or is not significantly probative, then a court may grant summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50.
The district court properly granted summary judgment on Cotuna's claim for failure to accommodate. Where [*5]  there is no direct evidence of discrimination, the ADA and ELCRA both use the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973); Hurtt v. Int'l Servs., Inc., 627 F. App'x 414, 419 (6th Cir. 2015); Sutherland v. Mich. Dep't of Treasury, 344 F.3d 603, 614 n.4 (6th Cir. 2003). Under this framework, "[t]he burden is first on the plaintiff to demonstrate a prima facie case of [] discrimination; it then shifts to the employer to offer a legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for its actions; finally, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show pretext—i.e. that the employer's explanation was fabricated to conceal an illegal motive." Chen v. Dow Chem. Co., 580 F.3d 394, 400 (6th Cir. 2009). To establish a prima facie failure to accommodate claim, a plaintiff must show that: "(1) he is disabled under the ADA; (2) he is otherwise qualified for the position, with or without a reasonable accommodation; (3) his employer knew or had reason to know of his disability; (4) he requested a reasonable accommodation; and (5) the employer failed to provide the reasonable accommodation." Aldini v. Kroger Co. of Mich., 628 F. App'x 347, 350 (6th Cir. 2015); see also DiCarlo v. Potter, 358 F.3d 408, 419 (6th Cir. 2004), overruled on other grounds by Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 180, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009).
The district court held that Walmart's failure to provide Cotuna with written notes detailing work instructions did not constitute a failure to accommodate because Cotuna did not notify Walmart that this request was in connection with his disability. The district court [*6]  held that it was Cotuna's responsibility to inform Walmart that the written notes were a necessary accommodation; Walmart was not required to speculate that this was the case. See Gantt v. Wilson Sporting Goods Co., 143 F.3d 1042, 1046-47 (6th Cir. 1998). Cotuna does not dispute this holding on appeal, but argues here that he did not notify Walmart that his request for written notes was a request to accommodate his disability because the "Action Plan" form on which he submitted the request did not have a field for medical accommodation. But what the form provided for is irrelevant; Cotuna still had the burden of informing Walmart that he was requesting an accommodation for his disability. See id.
Cotuna argues that indefinite leave can be a reasonable accommodation if it is not an undue hardship, and that it would not be an undue hardship in his case. Cotuna relies on Cleveland v. Federal Express Corp., 83 F. App'x 74, 78-79 (6th Cir. 2003), for the proposition that indefinite leave could, in theory, be a reasonable accommodation. But we have held that where, as here, "an employer has already provided a substantial leave, an additional leave period of a significant duration, with no clear prospects of recovery, is an objectively unreasonable accommodation." Maat v. Cty. of Ottawa, 657 F. App'x 404, 412 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting Walsh v. United Parcel Serv., 201 F.3d 718, 727 (6th Cir. 2000)).
Cotuna argues in his reply brief that he did not request indefinite [*7]  leave, because he requested time off only until February 15, 2013. Cotuna was still unable to return to work by October 2015, however, and was still receiving social security disability benefits. His requested leave was therefore functionally for an indefinite period. And Cotuna did not show a clear prospect for recovery. Thus, his reasonable accommodation claim is without merit.
The district court also properly granted summary judgment on Cotuna's discriminatory discharge claim. To prevail on a claim for discriminatory discharge under the ADA, Cotuna had to show that: "(1) he was disabled, (2) he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of his position, with or without reasonable accommodation; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; (4) [Walmart] knew or had reason to know of his disability; and (5) the position remained open or a nondisabled person replaced him." Green v. BakeMark USA, LLC, 683 Fed. Appx. 486, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 5488, 2017 WL 1147168, at *7 (6th Cir. Mar. 27, 2017); see also Plant v. Morton Int'l Inc., 212 F.3d 929, 936 (6th Cir. 2000). "To be 'qualified' under the ADA, [Cotuna] must be able to 'perform the essential functions of [his position]' 'with or without reasonable accommodation.'" EEOC v. Ford Motor Co., 782 F.3d 753, 761 (6th Cir. 2015) (en banc) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)).
Cotuna's disability prevented him from coming into work for over one year, and the accommodation he requested [*8]  would not have enabled him to perform the essential functions of his position. Thus, he was not qualified for the position under the ADA. See id. In his reply brief, Cotuna notes that he was able to perform his job until 2011, but this does not show that he was able to perform the essential functions of his job since that time. Because Cotuna has failed to articulate a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge, it is not necessary to consider whether he demonstrated that Walmart's proffered reason for dismissal was pretextual.
Cotuna also failed to establish a prima facie case of wage discrimination. "[I]n order to establish a prima facie case of wage discrimination under the EPA, plaintiffs must show that an employer pays different wages to employees of opposite sexes for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions." Schleicher v. Preferred Solutions, Inc., 831 F.3d 746, 752 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting Beck-Wilson v. Principi, 441 F.3d 353, 359 (6th Cir. 2006)). Cotuna's allegations that a female coworker received a raise when he did not are conclusory and unsupported by the record. The declarations Cotuna cites do not demonstrate that a female colleague received a raise, but only that she received a satisfactory [*9]  performance review. Cotuna also cites Walmart's internal investigation by Ken Brewer. Although that report identified other misconduct by Ashton-Hendrixson, it did not substantiate Cotuna's claim of unequal pay. Because Cotuna did not show that female colleagues received different pay for the same work as male colleagues, he did not establish a prima facie case of wage discrimination, and therefore the district court properly granted summary judgment on this claim.
The district court properly dismissed Cotuna's hostile work environment claims arising under Title VII and the ELCRA. To establish a prima facie case of a hostile work environment, a plaintiff must show that: "(1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on plaintiff's protected status; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to affect a term, condition, or privilege of employment; and (5) the employer knew or should have known about the harassing conduct but failed to take corrective or preventative actions." Fullen v. City of Columbus, 514 F. App'x 601, 606-07 (6th Cir. 2013) (citing Bailey v. USF Holland, Inc., 526 F.3d 880, 885 (6th Cir. 2008)); see also Kalich v. AT&T Mobility, LLC, 679 F.3d 464, 470 (6th Cir. 2012).
Cotuna asserts that he faced a hostile work environment due to his national origin and disability. However, [*10]  in his deposition he admitted that nobody made any comments about his national origin beyond asking him to speak better English, and that his belief that the treatment was due to his national origin was largely subjective. Cotuna points to Walmart's termination of Ashton-Hendrixson to support his claim. The record shows misconduct by Ashton-Hendrixson, but it does not show she harassed Cotuna because of his national origin. Cotuna also fails to establish that he was harassed on the basis of his disability, because an isolated and ambiguous comment that he needed to move faster does not amount to harassment. See Younis v. Pinnacle Airlines, Inc., 610 F.3d 359, 362 (6th Cir. 2010); Ercegovich v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 154 F.3d 344, 355 (6th Cir. 1998). Because Cotuna fails to satisfy the third and fourth elements, the district court properly granted summary judgment on this claim.
The district court properly granted summary judgment on Cotuna's retaliation claim. Walmart provided a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Cotuna: he failed to return to work after a lengthy leave without proper medical documentation. The burden is then on Cotuna to show that Walmart's reason for termination was pretextual, which he must do by providing evidence "(1) that the proffered reasons had no basis in fact, (2) that the [*11]  proffered reasons did not actually motivate the employer's action, or (3) that they were insufficient to motivate the employer's action." Chen, 580 F.3d at 400. Cotuna provided no such evidence.
For the forgoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.
